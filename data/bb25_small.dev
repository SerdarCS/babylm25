said Richard he said, I don't know how you do it in London he said, if they ever asked me to come down here he said I would die.
Yeah.
He said I would I would not be accepted .
Home home counties people like me could go anywhere.
Mm.
Richard erm if I now got to the stage of saying if if you had a choice, cos I have a luxury here of six companies er most recruiters just have one job for one company.
Mm.
I've got number of jobs for a number of companies.
So it's unusual and I get told off for giving you a choice but what do you think?
I I what I want to do is make, if people going into selling advertising for the first time and most people are let's face it
Mm.
er it is important for me to get the environment right.
Now I I've got I've got two or three in my own mind but erm that could you know
At at first glance I would probably decide I'd I'd actually enjoy the golf club one but I'm sure it doesn't pay as much money.
And I'm sure I wouldn't get as good a rewards out of that personally and satisfaction as I perhaps would I don't know.
Well there there are three there are three organizations or companies there that I think you'd be er happier in especially going out for the first time and also er your style.
Mhm go on.
Well
Let let me
certainly golf clubs would be one of them
Mhm
er schools and medical.
I wouldn't put you in er around and even though you've had experience strangely enough in the roofing industry and we get a lot of roofers in advertis er er how how do you which would you have chosen.
Erm
Strangely enough golf clubs actually you you can earn more money.
Can you?
Yeah.
It's probably a harder sell because it's four colour and it's nine hundred pound for a little space like that but they're doing quite well.
But the schools
But is that because a new innovation you see.
I mean I have 
Yeah we've we've had six months
you're breaking new ground.
We are breaking new ground here.
Because they've always let's be fair they've always been around so somebody else has been doing them.
Eagle Golf Promotions is the is the largest er a sales consultant has just er finished er my club off.
You know finished their done their card and he did that in about er four da er five days it was.
The card.
What from Eagle or ?
No no no Eagle you see Eagle Prom er Eagle Promotions charge clubs for their cards as well as keeping the advertising money.
Oh I see.
We keep the advertising money and the cards are free of charge.
Well 
So 
in fact all of that product there is free of charge.
But I what I need is any anybody 
So on there you've got er oh I wouldn't know what that adverts to do with
What's that one?
Oh the cards.
But that was if I remember rightly that was a mock-up.
Oh 
If you take the real thing.
I was going to say I
Yes that's that's
where to buy a ball.
Those those are nine hundred pound page per year for two years.
Nine hundred pounds per year?
Yep.
And if you sign them up do we get the commission for the 
For the first year only.
For the for the first year.
We don't get any paid anything in the second year ?
No.
Because all our production costs all our commissions come out of the first year.
Second year is actually where we make money.
So you do an three hundred pounds.
That's nine hundred
Yeah.
You'd get thirty percent.
Nine hundred and you would get thirty percent.
So you can work out that for for erm for that card which has got three full pages.
Then he was doing that's the planner he was doing the card at the same time erm Anyway that's the there's the that's the  the, but I need to make a decision
I'd I'd quite I'd quite enjoy the golf club one.
Right.
Er I just wondered what satura saturation you've had golf clubs
Oh we've only just started them.
up here.
Yeah.
So you'd be against Eagle as the main competitor if if they've got them already 
Oh yes we're we're knocking we're we're knocking Eagle.
Because I would've thought most golf 
We we would concern 
clubs have already got them.
Yes they have but they haven't got them for free.
They've saved my club four and a half thousand pound a year.
In the cost of their cards.
Yes.
And they they can soon put that somewhere else to er good use .
And what area would I be restricted to?
Okay what I what I need before 
All right okay 
I go into any more detail are we fixed on the golf club area?
You only go in one you see.
But the other one I would've er suggested would've been the schools.
I must admit I've never seen anything like that on schools.
No but that's 
But before 
also new.
be before we go into that though
Mm.
you would give the leads is that right as I read this?
Yes we we s 
You say you got to go to that golf club or you've got to go to that school.
That's right.
Yeah you have no 
Because we've set up a deal with that school 
Yeah.
for a brochure.
Our marketing our marketing er group has gone around to all the erm er the clients within that market place erm, well not all of them at least they're gradually going round signing the contract to take the product.
That's that's done already.
We you just get a phone call from us that says, Here's here's your next assignment.
We guarantee continuity of assignment.
Within within which area would that be?
How 
Well 
large an area?
well erm we we pay thirty percent commission up to a hundred miles away from home.
Right.
We pay thirty five percent if it's more than a hundred miles away from home.
But the whole point of recruiting in a geographical area like this is we don't want we don't want to send people erm er miles away from their home if we can avoid it.
Mm.
Erm I 
I just I just try to work out whether there must be a bigger concentration of schools in this area than than golf clubs.
But whether you'd manage to sign all schools  I'm not so sure .
Oh we we've just sent out a six thousand mailer.
Six thou a mailer to six thousand schools in addition to the ones we've already got signed up.
That would not be a problem.
Let me tell you you do not have to worry about continuity of assignment.
And all we say is that we pay extra commission if we send you away but it is against er  against  our principle and even er economics to send people that far away.
Right okay.
I I have to say the top earners of course ask for those further away.
That's where they make their money.
Yes.
Or make their extra money.
Mm.
Two things that make a people a top earner here of course is one of them one of them in addition to graft, is that they won't sit back and sign up one deal and be very satisfied in a day.
Mm.
They will want to go on and do two or three.
Mm.
They'll also have no compunction whatsoever in taking 
Well let's fair on the golf 
the thirty five percent deals.
On the golf club one if you've really got your finger out and you're known 
Oh 
well enough you could you could do one in day.
I'm a I I I'm an er avid golfer, you  I didn't say a golfer because that meant I could play, erm but I wouldn't put me on the golf clubs.
You wouldn't?
No.
I could s I I even though it might make me a lot of money because I know that if I got if I made a dozen phone calls and didn't get any deals I'd be out there wanting play the er I wouldn't trust myself .
I wouldn't take no no I wouldn't take the golf clubs with me.
Right okay.
But I need to sorry I need to make.
Are we are we going for schools or colleges?
Now if if the management at home heard me doing this of course er giving you a choice but I believe in it.
And you eat the tape afterwards.
Erm  you've put me on the spot I don't I don't I've really I've really got no preference on them.
Right well I let's I I I would go for schools if I were you.
Mm okay fair enough .
I mean cos it makes a difference the pack I bring out.
Yes sure .
That's that's why I'm putting you under pressure.
Right this is for you to take away.
I'm going to ver the well the information I impart now is in brief Richard because they will certainly cover it in a lot more detail when you get to the er training .
Okay.
Let's get some samples er in front of you all right?
I have to say once again that this, once again sorry I told somebody else this, this is the most attractive product we do I believe.
The schools are seem to be able to make them look attractive because of the photography and things like that.
And they are used to get bums on seats.
Since the parents choice charter came out it is it is essential for all school, state opt-out grant maintained independent, to promote themselves.
And that's why this has been so successful.
Every assignment has a certain amount of documentation attached to it.
Certainly when you arrive at the school they are committed by their contract to provide you with a desk office and and telephone facilities for two to three week or the duration of the assignment.
But we we agree that after three weeks we should be should have completed it.
Erm the advantage that schools has er have sorry, over the other products, is that if you went to a medical practice you may have four or five doctors to help you out.
If you went to an estate agent you may if they're willing to er have one or two estate agent staff to help you out and if you went to a golf club you would be likely to have the pro or the secretary help you out.
In a school you may have fifty to sixty teachers to help you out.
And what I mean by help out is that one of the documents that we leave er when we sign them up to take the product is a list that so that looks something like this.
And we ask them to bring together er list of the businesses which they are happy for us to approach on their behalf
Mm.
to support this folder.
So all of those people there or most of them are likely to have been on a list that the school have recommended.
They will form all sorts of categories too and the worst thing you can do in sa in er negotiating advertising er Richard is to prejudge anybody 
Oh I can 
who might come in.
Be completely wrong.
You'd be completely.
I've done it myself I've said no that guy what would that guy want to go in there for.
Except that, it was a butcher right?
People moving in, this was in the medical practice, people moving in new er new er new  first things you do is register with a doctor.
Mm.
And the the butcher was gaining a lot of business out of it.
Because they said, Ah fine I know where to go for my meat.
And they are associated with the with the doctor.
So I prejudged .
we did that with the with the chemist.
We phoned the chemist to find where the nearest and best doctor was when we moved to  Preston .
There you go you see.
And that chemist er would've recommended probably
The one that gets his scripts.
Absolutely right.
Okay so this list will be waiting for you when you arrive at the the assignment.
The important thing about that Richard is you still have to sit down and talk to them about these businesses.
Get as much information as to why they have been put on that list.
Because you'll use that when you  
contact.
Yes.
So don't ex just don't go straight into that list.
No no.
Okay.
Other documentation you receive and certainly is this one and you can't do your job without that and that's a blank of of the layout.
Okay?
So that as you sell the the slots, first of all you want you want to be able to point out where which the slot is when you've er er finally sign the contract.
You also need to cross off as you sell them.
Mhm.
Once again they will tell you precisely what you've gotta do on the er training course.
But let me show you er just while we've got that open how prices relate to those slots.
And also have got an example here of what the earnings are.
Every assignment on schools has a basic target of five thousand pounds all right?
And that's what you have to have up in your mind.
It also relates to once you know that you've reached that five thousand pound, that you've got your thirty percent commission on all sales.
Over five thousand pound we pay you another fifteen percent.
There's a small one before that but I would concentrate on fifteen percent.
Mhm.
All commission er bonuses are paid at proof stage and I'll explain why in a minute.
If you just look at some the er numbers here.
One po er positions one to four are nearly five hun well say five hundred pound each.
They're premium slots.
Okay?
And then we have two other erm pricing erm areas for those slots there .
Okay I'll let you study this when you when you've gone all right?
Mhm.
Now some of the schools have asked for this spa , this by the way is belongs to the school.
Some schools have asked for that to be kept for the sch er you know for them as well.
If they take up that space you must offer up the back page.
That's which is traditionally theirs.
Yep.
In fact I think I not sure whether it's this one.
That's an example.
And also the school got that company for us.
But that's a two thousand two hundred page.
The commission on that is a third.
You can work that out for yourself.
Mhm.
You can't do the job without that.
No.
You get one of those for every assignment.
Okay.
Er a quick example down here.
If you sold the whole of that product at non-discounted prices that's the revenue.
And with schools it's very achievable.
That is the earning in your two to three week period.
Mhm.
So if you took a six week period then you're looking at somewhere around four and a half thousand pounds worth of income.
Very achievable.
I emphasized just now about the extra five percent.
I've put that in bold down there so that people understand that.
Right.
And of course that's substan makes that compounded up that makes it even more.
Mhm.
Okay?
That's for 
Yep okay.
you to take away.
We will pay all commissions the following week.
All right?
Now we're one of the very few companies that will pay weekly commissions on a commission only basis.
And the reason for that is that we ask you to do three things when you get in front of the advertiser having got his commitment.
And I'll show you very quickly the documentation.
All six companies have exactly the same contract.
The only difference is and I hope you're not colour blind
Yes.
Are you?
Are you really?
Yeah.
Oh dear.
What colour's that to you?
Oh no that's green you're okay.
I might have known.
No it's just the different different shades of green.
You're the first person I've said that to who said come back to me and said yes.
Yeah I am actually.
Those are both white I can assure you.
But it what I'm saying is that they're all shades of colour anyway.
Yes.
But erm they they're they're erm colour coded .
But but I'll only have one anyway.
That's right.
So what whatever colour 
I wanted to make sure that you see if if er at some stage, and people ask me this, if if we needed to transfer people
Oh I see.
between companies we don't have to retrain them on on 
No.
the admin which does help.
Only on the pitch.
Well my my problem only is is when the blues run into greens and the reds run into browns.
Oh when you get bleeds that's what we call
Erm I have been known to go out with one black sock on and blue sock on.
Oh have you really oh well.
I think I think we've all done that at some time or other.
Certainly odd socks.
Erm so but I wanted to point out two or three things on this contract that if you don't tell them on the phone about them before you get round there they they'll use it 
They'll frighten they use it 
The system tells us they'll use you'll frighten them off.
And this is these are the sorts of things.
You must tell them that you want to pick up a thirty five percent of the first year's payment.
Whatever the payment is agreed.
That is significant because that covers us for paying you commission.
So we've already got that.
Mhm.
So we've got that so you deserve to have it as soon as possible after banking it.
Er we need to tell them that we'll take the balance of the first year's payment through er er on proof, when we when they've got their proof on on the desk we will take the next the balance of the first year's payment through a banker's order.
Banker's order they'll use if if you haven't told them that we want a banker's order signed.
If there are two signatories on the cheque you've gotta have two signatories on the er banker's order.
So you have to make sure both sure tho both of those people are there 
when you call.
If you left this anywhere left it behind and came away it would be lost in the system you'd never see it again.
No.
And we take the second year's, this is a sales pitch, we take the second year's payment a year later.
So if they say, Oh I can't afford that .
Then you say no it's a three stage payment in effect.
Mm.
Deposit first year second year a year later .
So it would be a deposit balance of first year at proof stage and then erm
But obviously there's somebody at head office you will be going through that in much more detail.
Mhm.
Er one of the other things that we want of course.
Now that's two things, contract and the cheque.
The third thing we want to complete the deal is copy.
Now most people that come to see us have never been involved in designing or writing ads.
We you don't er nobody has to worry about that.
If they had wonderful.
I mean I had so I it did help.
We will take whatever copy they have in existence all ready where they've advertised somewhere else.
If they want us to juggle it around we will do it.
If they want us to design a brand new one we will do it at no extra cost.
So the artwork is not a problem you have to get involved in .
Is not a problem.
Right.
If they say we've got co I haven't got copy.
What's that gonna cost me?
Nothing.
I'll come round when we sign the deal after we've signed the deal I'll sit down with you for er er fifteen minutes however long it takes to decide on the copy.
Then we will compose it as long as we've got some detail.
Mhm.
If you send all those er bits and pieces in at the end of the week we just ask you and you most people don't get this wrong.
Is the commission claim sheet.
Representative oh well there you go, consultant number every assignment has a unique number.
We list the advertisers put all this detail down which once again will be er will be gone through.
Er if people have registered for V A T there's a special V A T er sheet.
Because some of course are they they reach the thirty six thousand threshold without any problem at all.
I mentioned bonuses being paid at proof stage.
Every two months a list comes out to the sales consultants to say these assignments have been proofed.
All you have to do is look for your own number er if you if you have hopefully you've kept a record of the assignments where you've earned bonus and you can claim it as soon as that number is published.
A lot of people leave it in 
Can you can you just explain that bit again
Okay.
the bonus.
Right.
Bonus all er all your thirty percent is are are paid as you declare it during the assignment week after 
Ah sorry yeah so the fif the the five percent or the fifteen point seven and a half or whatever it is 
Fifteen percent fifteen percent you claim only at proof stage.
Because that's the next stage at which we get money.
Right okay.
That's the way you do it.
Mhm.
Okay.
That's a fairly average week for a lot of people.
That was this is one of mine.
Er my last but one.
Er that's the sort of figure that we're we need to be looking at.
Right.
Okay?
Mhm.
Just to show you.
Er everything's colour coded.
Oh I see this is just for different names of the different in-house companies 
that's golf that's schools, that's the one that you would use obviously.
Same thing just the headings change a bit okay?
Yes.
That's all we ask you to do.
The advertising the paperwork and that's how easy it is to make money.
It's available to you.
Is that for you?
Sounds very interesting I must admit.
Mm.
Yeah well I I I obviously I would say this but er I think it's the best opportunity that people have for a career direction because we we've redirected a lot of people's careers in this aspect.
And also we've I suppose re-launched people's er especially in the older bracket
Yes unfortunately 
who who erm are consistently being told they're too old for things.
We have no problem with that at all.
In fact the more mature the better as far as I'm concerned.
I would trust er you much more than er erm a twenty five or thirty year old out there to get on and do the job.
Yeah.
I think er with experience becomes the the self-motivating part is something that er
Yes.
becomes inherent I think.
Er there don't seem to be quite a lot of that any more.
No.
They've had it a bit too easy I think.
Absolutely.
Well the only thing that as far as I'm concerned erm er Richard is is when would you like to come on the training course?
Right.
Erm I have as I say one other if you like self-employed business opportunity that I have been pursuing erm which erm I shall know after Tuesday of next week.
Right.
Erm which also sounds very interesting.
Yes.
What market is it in can I ask?
Yeah it's erm er consultancy in er business travel.
Is that a franchise or or what ?
No no no no you basically the company is pulled out of the ordinary high street travel business and set up a new concept in business travel.
Mm.
Therefore with no overheads .
Is this a new venture?
It was been going for two years.
Mm.
Erm but they er have only done it on a localized basis.
Erm you earn commission by taking clients who might spend say a hundred thousand pounds on business travel, whether it be flights trains
Yes.
hotels whatever.
And you sign them up or when I say sign them up they're er an account is opened
Mhm.
for them.
Right.
And you can show them of between an eighteen and twenty four percent saving on their business travel.
Oh I've got a suspicion I'm getting.
Hello.
Yep.
Right.
Thank you.
And erm obviously I've got a lot of contacts in the industry.
Erm
Right.
and it's something that I I I like the idea of
Mm.
but again like this one I need to get to know the a bit more of the ins and outs of it.
I've had a preliminary meeting with them and they've asked me to go back because they're interested in me.
Okay.
Er and that's been fixed up to go to Wilmslow in Cheshire next Tuesday.
Right.
I would like the opportunity of saying yes I am very interested.
Er but I would like to reserve making er a decision until after Tuesday.
Now whether that's a problem to you I don't know.
It would be a problem with certain people.
I would say sorry in that case er you know I wouldn't you know.
But with you I I'm happy to
It's not I'm I'm not pursuing any other P A Y E 
cos I know I know which the safer bet is and that's all I'm going to say.
Sure.
I will make er er provisional with you.
Okay.
So that you can come.
I will go through all the the bits and pieces here now and then it's all done.
Mhm.
If you phone me up and say, Yes I want to come it's all done .
Well that's what I was going to say if if we could make it that the training course came after next week and not next week then 
No I'll tell you when the next course is for erm schools  seventh the week commencing the seventh of February.
In fact which is just right isn't it?
Yes.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay.
So I'm gonna go through  right
And is that three or five days?
I've done I'll just go
Okay.
through in a minute it's three days.
Yeah.
Date is the twenty sixth yes?
Yes.
It is isn't it yes.
Okay on Friday the seventh.
This is on the assumption that everything is going ahead all right?
Friday the six fourth that would be won't it?
Yes.
All right.
Prior to this you would have given us a phone call okay?
Mhm.
But on Friday the fourth erm I'd like you to er if ev the best thing is to read through this 
Okay.
Tells you all about where we do our erm oh er beg your pardon four day training of course I should've
Four days.
Four beg your pardon.
Okay.
Yes that's the trouble with having six companies.
They all have slightly different er variations.
Okay it's er this goes all into the detail.
Erm the Fernlea I'll tell you what I've got here the Fernlea Hotel is where the course is held and you stay and the Fernlea is somewhere around here.
There's a pier here which we've put on the new map erm and this is south promenade.
Okay?
Fernlea's somewhere around there if that helps you.
We pick up, there's the details there.
If you read that we need you to phone into that lady and it's Vivienne.
No.
Okay.
I can you can't.
I can't.
Not yet.
You come over on the Sunday evening because we do start prompt at eight thirty on the Monday morning.
Okay.
That's the hotel.
Right.
Okay.
This is all for you to take away.
If you please read that.
I will.
You phone me erm whatever your commitment is er to either us or the other people.
Mhm.
And then if you follow that procedure I'd be grateful.
Okay.
We'll pay your travel costs.
Right.
To we'll pick up all your tab but er we'll pay this separately.
Mhm.
Just need you to sign
Oh you want me to sign.
Yes just sign to say you know about that.
There's a copy there for you.
The other thing I've got to do is take a photograph.
Oh god is my hair okay I've been out  in the wind you know .
No it's all right.
All I all I ask you to do is smile.
We get some great glum looking photographs.
Oh I I'm going to vet that .

I call them discussions I don't call them interviews.
Because we're 
Mhm right.
not offering quote a job.
Er it's a business opportunity.
Mhm.
Self employed commission only.
We make it absolutely on the phone.
There you are.
You did.
So that you know that I do takes notes at the other end.
There are my notes and that it absolutely critical for us to know.
All right yes.
I haven't just done that.
It's quite a different coloured pen.
Yeah.
He did mention that to me he did say that to me .
Yeah erm There are two or three things er that erm we are essential for us to find out when people phone in.
Well first of all whether the the whole environment of selling advertising appeals.
Mhm.
Whether they can be understood on the phone.
And I'm not worried about accents.
No no.
I'm just if I can understand 
I think they are more acceptable nowadays anyway aren't they ?
Oh sure.
If I can understand people after twenty five thirty years in sales and marketing listening to people on the phone and knowing how important it is in this  then I then that's fine.
But I've actually spoken to an even a a real Tyne and Wear Geordie accent
Yes.
I say I'm sorry I cannot understand a word you're saying.
Yes.
Or very sorry I find it very difficult to understand
Yes yes.
er so it wouldn't be any good for us.
Mhm.
Because we're talking to a lot of professional people who are from all Scots you name it they're from it.
Yeah.
So that's why we we make the advert curious enough or enough curiosity in it, no vagueness I suppose we make it vague enough to say I've got to phone in.
Some people will say to us, Now I've seen your ad there's paper 
and that paper there are two things I get from that.
Either you've got a massive turnover in staff or erm you're going somewhere.
I say well it's definitely the latter.
The latter.
But there is a certain element of the former.
Yes.
Because in any self employed situation you're always going to get people who find something quote better
Mhm.
in their opinion and that's that and and they get it.
Mhm.
But in terms of turnover in staff I would I would be fairly confident in saying we have the lowest one of the lowest if not the lowest in any direct sales operation.
Mhm.
We happen to have the largest direct sales force of its kind in the U K anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We want three hundred people by the end of this year because the business we've already got just waiting to be done in phenomenal.
Well
And is and is a continuation of business or is this referrals?
Well when you when you understand er when you get to understand the products I mean there's there all our six companies are represented over there er Maggie
Right.
Erm er one thing that is common across all of those products is exactly what the consultants do.
And that is bring together the advertising to fund the product.
Mhm.
Non of that product is or ever has been or is ever going to be sold.
Mm right.
It's all given to
Mhm.
you see this this this one you brought in here
Mhm.
unless the local printer's very cleaver somehow and got that advertising to to sponsor er the booklet they've had to charge for it.
Mhm.
Or they have to do what we will never do and that is take the quality out of it.
Now the doctor may be quite happy with that.
Say no.
Yes.
By law he's not even obliged to give them that as something as posh as that or smart as that.
All he needs to do is to do a photocopy
Yes.
Yeah which is what I got from my doctors actually.
That's what I got from mine.
Did you?
Until they came up with er a very cheap version of that .
Yes.
And I was disappointed I went and say, Hey
Mm.
by that time I'd been involved with .
Yes.
Erm but one of the things they did not like is for erm to have a sales consultant on the medical practice for three weeks using their 
Right.
telephones because that's part of the deal.
Mhm.
If you're not prepared to sign that contract then forget it.
Mhm.
Erm so there's no point in talking.
There are still a number of er medical practices around who still don't agree with advertising.
Mm.
Even though their own 
Yes.
B M A have said it's quite
Yes.
and the general medical council have said no problem.
That to get back to part of your original question, the company existed on folders the the estate agent folders, for fifteen years.
Five years six years ago they introduced the postal wallets because they found that estate agents were sending the very expensive glossy brochures out in the post.
It was costing them extra in postage
Mhm.
and they kept asking us to print more.
Right.
And that was expensive.
Mhm.
Postal wallets were the wonderful spin-off from there.
And they are now getting to the point where they are are popular as the folders in terms of 
Mhm.
the estate agents that take them.
Yes.
Medical practice booklets four years ago or it's five years now I guess, five years ago erm er it's almost five, legislation was brought in by the then Health Secretary Ken Clarke now our dear Chancellor.
Erm when 
You might think so.
Well yes no I said, Dear.
Should I say expensive Chancellor?
Erm 
Yeah.
but he did I a favour at  by bringing out er a law that said that they must provide something like this.
Yes.
We went to the er B M A or the G M C I'm not quite sure which and asked if we could could approach er doctors for this and they've been snapping our hands off ever since.
Schools universities and colleges they were a spin-off from the parents' choice charter.
Right.
They have to promote themselves now just as they've got to get bums on seats as they say.
Mhm mhm yes.
Er golf clubs well golf clubs will take anything they get for free.
Mhm that's true.
And we bought the company last year that did that so that 
Right.
brought it into the fold.
Now so in a in a way I've answered your your er question by saying that erm we are doing an awful lot of reselling.
Every two years we reprint this product and we resell the advertising.
Mhm.
And as we take on new assignments er two years time they'll be resales.
So it's an ongoing process that the first medical pra or some medical practice booklets are just coming up for their second resale.
Mhm right.
Schools universities and colleges in er about a year's time the first resales.
Mhm.
That's they're all the new ones.
So there is absolutely tons of work.
Mhm.
That's why we give an absolute guarantee that we will give you continuity of assignment.
Mhm.
Nobody sits at home twiddling their fingers.
Erm I can guarantee one other thing
It's intriguing sorry go on.
you will earn a far sight more money than the TEC will ever pay you.
Even though they've been squandering our money now.
Haven't they?
Oh.
It's
I was my own company er does management training and I won't touch the TECs
Yeah.
Cos I see all the waste and all the people in those organizations.
And thankfully us independent consultants in training have just been er vindicated for all we've ever said about them.
Because they've come out with a report saying what we've been saying for the 
Have they?
last few years.
Mhm.
Jobs for the boys it was.
I feel very strongly about that because it was mine your  
Yes yes.
An application form.
If you wanna have a look through some of those products while 
Yes.
I'm have a glance through this Maggie erm please do.
I know these ones.
Oh there'll probably be some er names that you've seen
Mm.
and recognize.
Yeah this is our this is our area this one.
Oh which one's that?
Oh right yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
That's a strange 
size I don't why I don't know if we still do those.
But er that came er into my hands 
Gazette.
recently so.
yes.
So erm that's a strange size.
I think somebody brought that in from er he he'd gone along when I was up here a few weeks back.
Mhm.
So I kept it.
So there's er quite a varied erm sales background here Maggie .
Mm yes.
Yes.
Stationery er Universal Supplies.
I was at Universal twice .
Is that the big company?
Yes.
That's the that's the one that prints the catalogue and then personalizes it.
I'm sure I've  I said to you on the phone I think .
Yes.
Cos I made a note Universal
Yes it is and they have you know most of their own own brands which is where they make their money obviously.
Mm.
Hampers now there's a there there's erm a market place that's advertising all the time.
Was 
Yes.
this was this done by you know the subscription each week or each month?
I didn't work on that side actually Rod.
I worked on business to business.
Oh okay fine.
Is there still 
And I and I 
er oh to the corporate market.
Yeah.
I used to go to all the erm exhibitions Olympia and GMEX and all of those.
Erm and then it was my job to chase up all the leads afterwards.
Right.
Good fun?
Yes.
Yes.
Doing the exhibitions yes.
Yes.
I had some sore feet 
Hard work
Yeah I know.
But er everybody thinks oh you're going away stay in a nice hotel.
I used to run a training course on on how to run exhibitions and one of the things that that female were always surprised about I said don't where high heels on the exhibition stand .
Yes yes.
You still see them doing it.
Yes.
Oh it's not worth it is it?
My feet are hurt, change your shoes dear.
Thankfully fashions have changed somewhat now 
Yeah that's right.
haven't they?
That's that's er that's we are I think we are subject to fashion all the time.
So the lads have er flown the coop have they?
No no.
The thirty year old is still at home.
Really.
Can't get rid of him.
Can't get rid of him.
And he's been working erm in in the shop.
We've just closed a delicatessen actually.
Oh right that's right you had a deli didn't you?
Erm yeah Ken had one and he's managed to erm secure early release from erm the lease which was due to finish in July.
Er but since the multiples started trading on a Sunday last year our sales just went down.
And you're a grandmother too.
Yes yeah.
And you dote on him I guess.
We do.
He comes every weekend.
Does he?
Oh.
He comes Friday to Sunday we keep him.
Oh can I go to grandma and granddad.
It's a big problem at the moment.
Now what's this?
Nights at the pub network.
Yeah.
Or is that nights at the pub 
Networking 
and networking?
Well it well it's really just it it mixes in doesn't it?
You just meet people erm you know
Oh sure.
Erm and it's all to do with contacts because I'm still running my own business erm of of 
Doing what?
selling hampers.
Oh right.
But this is 
I didn't I didn't hear that.
this is something though, well they're all finished now at Christmas.
But this is 
Oh you that's right 
something that Ken would like to take over now.
Ken?
My husband.
Because he's always been in er in food.
Mm.
Okay.
Erm and I'm you know I'm sure now it's it's
Yeah it's one thing that er we have to reem reemphasize to people and usually I do it on the phone, that if people have got businesses erm the way  look at it there's such a commitment by this company to
I can imagine that.
for the self-employed even the self-employed status
Yes yes.
erm we guarantee.
Er you can see the sort of backup er from the brochure
Yes yeah.
what sort of that we have.
We not have to give we're obliged to give in terms of to keep the company going.
Yes yeah.
Erm and we are fully aware that some people have got other things
Mm.
quote .
But it's when it interferes with the  thing.
They'd say
Yes.
well it's you know it's one 
Yes yes.
or the other.
Yes.
But if there're a lot of people have got evenings you know
Mm.
network marketing and things like that.
Mm.
As long as 
I think network marketing I think it I think that turns out to be jolly hard work because if you're not recruiting it's the recruitment part of it .
Oh yeah.
That has to be 
If you're not recruiting.
Yes I mean my wife and I have had a go at that.
Have you?
We're still we're still there but erm it it was the number of people you had to approach to get one into you.
Because I there's nothing wrong with it.
Eth ethically the Government have cleared it and in fact have forecast that it's going to be the one .
The yes yes 
The marketing concept.
Yeah.
Certainly is in the State and Japan
I was gonna say it's 
sixty seven percent of business goes through network marketing .
it's more commonly known 
Yeah.
abroad isn't it?
Unfortunately it still has the pyramid selling er
Tag.
attached.
Mm mm.
That's right.
And of course that's illegal.
I've got no  
Yeah we looked at er N S A.
We looked at.
Well that's who we're with.
Are you?
Yeah.
Oh right.
I wonder if this is where er  from then?
Who?
My my friend from er he lives at Sheffield.
Right.
I wonder if that's where he's heard of you then because he you know he introduced me to N S A.
Oh right.
I I went to some of the meetings and 
Yes.
I did a couple of workshops.
I don't Ian  name doesn't er
But er Ian .
Doesn't ring a bell.
No.
No.
But that's where I go.
I started down there with Wakefield
Right.
at Wakefield.
Yeah.
Oh yes I mean there I've I've I wouldn't be without my er filter and my er 
Filter well I have one yes yeah.
And the security products are very good too.
Yes.
Well I didn't see those because I didn't stay long enough.
Mm.
Right er I've got nothing wrong with it.
But of course the recruitment aspect is really 
Mm mm.
difficult and and now of course we we still retain our our distributorship but er we're not very active.
Erm okay.
There's the background there I've met you for for ten minutes.
I've spoken to you on the phone.
You can knock this one into a cocked hat Maggie.
Could I?
Yes absolutely.
I will tell you right now.
Well let me explain.
Two or three things that we need to decide here today and that's the purpose of these discussions.
Is A whether you and I think that this is er erm, if you can forget what your friend  told you about 
Yeah.
I it did I mean I thought afterwards I shouldn't have said that to er John  because he would be thinking, Oh here's negative Nelly coming along.
No that's all right.
Erm 
Erm 
You know we've got people that erm 
But I think if you put your thoughts on the table at least you all know where you're starting from 
Oh sure fine.
don't you.
Erm in fact you notice I didn't even make a note on it.
It just er I remember him saying something to me.
Oh you you somebody said that they had a bad time with erm
Because I was insistent I want I want I wanted to speak to Rod  and er I said no I when is con when is it convenient to ring back then cos he said he's got the phone glued to his ear blah blah.
Yes.
And erm well I am the same status and I am his colleague and all this you know I can help you .
John gets very defensive okay.
Yeah.
Er nice guy but he's never been in recruitment.
Right.
So he er but he had sold.
In fact he er I understand he was a very good er advertising salesman.
Yes.
They brought him inside to erm recruit without giving him any training at all and what I do has been gained over the last twenty years of recruitment.
Mm mm.
So erm in fairness to him I think he was plunged into something he didn't have a hell in er hope in at that time of coping with.
If somebody was interviewed by him and had a bad time, I can tell you I had a bad time, well to me it was a bad time, when I with him and he saw he spoke with me.
Er when I was asked for my opinion afterwards erm er I said er well I I quite honestly I wasn't er interviewed.
I thought for thought for fifteen minutes I was er should I or should I not join the company.
Mhm mhm.
If you have that bad feeling, well not join the company but .
However that's .
Erm now the three two or three things that we're talking about today really is, er and one we've just got over I think, is that you and I er I'm I'm absolutely certain you'd knock this into a cocked hat.
I've had other people here that don't come anywhere near your background and and your style and particularly your voice.
Which is so critical to us.
Mhm.
Erm the other thing is to for you and I decide er well once you tell me that you're happy er with what's happened so far.
Erm the other aspect is to decide where you feel that you er could be most comfortable environmentally.
Mhm.
In other words in what environment will you feel comfortable with working in.
Mhm.
Now I have one of those erm it is a luxury because I have erm six companies where I want people in the north east.
And to have a choice like that it means that anybody who comes in here  is not in competition with everybody else.
Mhm.
I can legitimately offer most people that came here today er I happen to have rejected a couple.
Erm because that's also what we don't do hide behind reject letters.
Mm mm.
Er regret letters.
Erm is er the other thing is when.
Mm.
When we can start.
We do have a fully expensed training course at head office.
They vary only very slightly across all six companies but the most common thing is that that we won't send people out
Mhm.
erm blind.
Mhm.
Okay?
Well that's not good for either is it?
No.
I can't I can't sell unless I'm happy with the product.
Er unless I believe in it myself I can't erm
Well er this company has er survived for twenty years.
It has it can't stop growing.
Mm.
Erm we we own all the property at head office.
There's no mortgage.
Mhm.
We just bought a printing 
Brilliant.
Yes I know.
In fact if you did a Dunn and Bradstreet 
That's lovely isn't it?
on us it would count, in effect we're cash rich.
Yes yeah.
The concept's so simple and and the country's littered with people who thought they could do it as well as us.
Mm.
I noticed all the nice motors as well.
I was thinking I would 
As in fact I had a go at that I had a go at I had a go at them about another prod er another photograph.
They've obviously lined up er all the best possible cars in the car park.
I'm not sure is that the same photograph?
Have a look at this one.
Yes it is actually we use it on one of our other brochures but they've they've got all the er all the nice cars.
And you see it when it generally er and also it's a perfect day.
I haven't seen a perfect day like that over in Blackpool yet.
But in fact where it starts here to there's the Old Mill
Right.
Right.
These have been added on.
Mhm.
It goes right the way you can see over there.
It goes right the way back.
Now right at the back here further down is erm the building belongs to us, all of this is own without a mortgage by us, right at the end er is we we've leased erm a section out to Pickfords
Oh right yes.
They're moving we so desperately need, I think we've terminated and bought the lease er bought the remaining lease.
We leased it to them because we need that area.
We're building new training schools, we've already got a big one up on er in one of the er it's it's this end here.
Mhm.
That's the whole of the training school.
Cos you 
Crikey 
can see all the smokers gathering along there  
sales meeting.
When you have a sales meeting there's the whole all the sales people who smoke, because it's a totally no smoking company.
Yes yeah.
They have they by law they have to .
I don't smoke I like that.
By law they have to put somebody er put somewhere in there for people to smoke.
But it's totally no smoking all the way through.
Mhm.
And you see all the smokers  lining up there  .
So that yes.
In fact that shows the erm doesn't show .
But they've been there for twenty years on that spot.
And of course we are looking at other products all the time.
I'm just investigating for the company er going onto radio.
Taking our ad that 
Ah.
you see.
So if people say to you well we're always seeing their ad.
Yes.
You will because we're determined that ev you'll see our ad a lot .
Everybody will.
.
Excuse me.
Mhm.
But it does give to some people that that will demonstrate that we're always looking for people
Yes.
Mhm.
because we can't hold people.
Yes mhm.
Well the the reverse is true.
Always looking for people because we need to add on.
How do you feel Maggie so far?
Are you are you erm
It sounds very interesting.
Mhm.
Okay.
What about environment which one would you ?
What about environment?
Now which one would you choose?
Erm I don't know really.
I don't know.
Erm I mean tell me in more depth how it works
Right.
Erm you know from the 
Simply our consultants, go on ask the full question sorry.
How it works?
Yeah.
I mean obviously you erm create the the interest.
Right.
Now what we do erm and this takes an awful lot of workload from the sales consultant.
Mm mhm.
We set up all the assignments.
We have a separate marketing er executive group.
Right.
That are travelling the U K right now on behalf of more than one of the companies.
We have a marketing executive who signs up golf clubs.
We have er two marketing execs three in fact that sign up schools medical practices and we have four I think to sign up estate agents.
Mm.
All independently of each other going round to the, well I say independently, but they obviously get fed a lot of information from head office where we have a telesales operation.
Right.
Who do nothing else but phone businesses and organizations and surgeries and golf clubs and tell them about our products.
Right.
They they will have the same script almost and say this is a free of charge item, all we need from you is this this and this and if you're interested I'm gonna ask a marketing executive to come in and agree a contract with you.
Mm.
In simple terms that's what they say.
Right mhm.
Marketing exec goes around signing up the contracts.
Mhm.
Right?
There will be certain discussions which I'll go into in a minute, at the at that stage which will determine what we're going to do for them.
What we're going to do for them is certainly provide a free of charge product, it's the numbers
Right.
and the when we're going to do it.
Yes.
And the who's going to do it is not determined until a couple of days before either party knows.
In other words if the estate agent or medical practice will get a phone call from us and say look we'd like to do your assignment is it convenient.
They may say, Oh wow no we're just having something done at the surgery rebuilt.
Right.
Got a couple of new doctors coming in a new practice manager can you leave it for three months.
Okay so we put that back.
Another one leapfrogs.
Right.
And then we say who's available it's it's come up in North Shields erm who is available who is just finishing an assignment.
Oh Maggie is erm fine where is she at the moment, oh she's at Hexham right well we'll give her a call at Hexham and say this is where your new assignment is going to be.
Right okay.
And that finishes on the Friday or whichever day of the week and you start the next day.
You can start the next day.
If you decide you want a couple of days off to take your grandson shopping
or something like that, er or your husband even with his cheque book, then you just have to tell us.
Mm mhm.
But if you have to tell us that you wanna week off we need some notice.
Because that might be right in the middle of an assignment and they 
Yes.
do not like that.
No no.
That's fair enough.
No.
So if you want one 
So you've got to tie all your loose ends up haven't you?
So all of this is all set up for you.
Right okay.
So that's really you literally only have to listen to the phone call and turn up.
Mhm.
All right?
Now most of the people who come to see us have never sold advertising have never wanted to.
What we do is provide them all er all of them with er a training course an awareness which does include on some with some companies two days out in the field.
Either before or after the course.
Right?
Right.
Medical practices for instance two days beforehand before coming in for three days.
Right.
Fully expensed we pay all all travelling and hotel bills.
Mhm.
The reason I'm say ask people to erm give me some idea of where they feel, I may have my own ideas, where they feel, depends on the information I impart on people.
That's why I like to get that out of the way.
But in essence we are erm all of the sales er marketing execs are discussing the same thing with whichever organization.
Mhm.
How many booklets how many postal wallets how many cards how many folders we're gonna print for them.
Right.
That will depend on the information we get from them.
Mhm.
We are er going to ask them to compile a list of businesses which they are happy for us to approach.
Mhm right.
How are you doing your telemarketing at at the TEC?
I've been provided with lists.
And what what what typically are they?
Erm people erm the TEC database actually
All right.
and people who have responded to circulars that they've just sent out.
Where they're offering the free hours counselling and er and the two days yeah you know consultancy 
and the investors  okay yes all right.
Okay and what's the sort of reaction that you're getting from them?
Very good actually because it's free though isn't it?
You you can't really knock it can you?
No.
Now that would be an ea that's er telemarketing in it's in it's pure sense in that you're offering something free are you interested 
It's softest form isn't it?
it's soft.
We have to harden ourselves up for this.
Mm mhm mhm.
But if you've got the right attitude and right, as I said on the notes, right voice and the right er personality, it it's just the same as having somebody face to face.
We have the luxury of course of having to go face to face anyway.
Yes yes.
Because most telesales people don't, even in advertising.
Mhm.
They do it all through the fax
So after you you've erm do it would I then go out to see people, is this what you're meaning?
Yeah.
Once you've go we what we don't do in in advertising erm whatever your er your son may do himself, is it your son in in advertising?
No.
No.
Where did I get that from?
Don't know.
He he was in the deli with us .
Oh sorry that was my last 
my last.
That's how you carry on.
If I play my tape back I'll me say that again.
Erm no in in terms of selling advertising we make sure that the prospective advertiser knows absolutely everything on the phone.
Mhm.
We don't make appointments to go and see people to talk about advertising.
Only to talk about the contract and the copy.
Mhm.
And to pick up a deposit cheque.
Right.
If you if there are certain things that if you don't tell them on the phone, including the price, we tell we talk price.
Yeah there's the price it's size it's this product you know the reason we're phone you because you've been identified as by the estate agent or medical practice or school as being very suitable and they would very much like you to support this.
Right okay.
And it will cost you this.
It will cost you this per year for two years.
Mhm.
And it will it will get to this number of people and this is how it will be used.
Now that's not face to face that is on the phone .
That's right yes yeah mhm.
And one of the things they do on the training course is is to compile a script with you.
Mhm right.
And I had a script but after a while you don't you set that aside and use your own style.
Mhm.
I know 
It's a good base to work on.
Yeah.
They sometimes come across stilted don't they when you're trying to
Yes that's right.
trying to do your own thing and 
Yes and don't don't break in I've got to read my script.
So that's that's
Yes.
in in a nutshell what we do.
Mhm.
And quite honestly about it.
It's not people only make this job difficult I believe erm if they don't listen to the people who's who have been doing these things for twenty years.
Mhm.
And er I include myself in that by having been in sales and marketing for all those years I thought I I could do anything.
Mm.
But this is so different to what I'd been doing as it is for most people.
Mhm.
Well as to which discipline erm
I feel you can do this and I know you I think you know you can do this.
I would think erm estate agents or schools.
Yeah I wouldn't put you in estate agents.
Wouldn't you?
Why?
They've been going for twenty years and er there's er school is very much, I would have put you straight into schools
Would you?
Yes.
Oh well.
I'm glad you if you if you'd 
So I was half way there then wasn't I 
have only mentioned estate agents I'd have I'd have been disappointed because
Yes.
you know now you've given me a let out.
Erm schools I think schools is just up your street mainly because erm And I'll tell you another why I think schools will benefit a lot of people going, first of all it's a fairly new product so we're really in the launch up stage.
Mm.
That actually benefits us here by the way.
Remember estate agents have been going for so long they say, Oh is that another folder?
Mhm mhm.
Whereas you say I'm I'm responding here for Gosforth Park School or whatever you know, that might not exist but,
Yes.
erm er any school because estates state schools and independent schools
That's right.
erm there's a certain prestige about erm going on to a school.
As there is with all of those but not necessarily estate agents.
Yes.
However, the other aspect is that if you go to a medical practice you may have four or five doctors to help you out.
If you go to an estate agent you may have two people to help you out.
Mhm.
Go to a golf club you may have just the golf secretary.
Go to a school you've got fifty to sixty teachers.
Mm mm.
And I recommend to anybody who goes on the school, I'm sure they do on the training course, that the first opportunity I would have to address erm the con er the staff meeting, you just say this is what I who I am this is why I'm here I've got a list of businesses which the school has provided with me already but I I will I may erm if I bump into you in the corridor I may just say do you know anybody else.
Mhm.
And they they you know if you've got a bit of style and and maturity about you that will go down well.
Mhm.
Let's talk about schools.
Mhm okay.
That determines the pack I bring out you see.
Right.
I may keep that that'll be helpful I'll send that back to the school er to the er Incidentally would you like a cup of tea?
I'm fine thanks Rod actually no I'm fine thanks.
Would you mind if I ordered one cos I am
No not at all no .
I missed lunch and everything.
Yes that coffee must be .
When my wife transcribes this she'll say 

Thank you Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen.
There have been suggestions in recent years that there's a sub-group of patients with  bladder cancer in whom there is a reduced likelihood of recurrence, and it may be possible in those patients to amend the follow-up protocol and omit the six and nine month check cystoscopies.
Before implementing such change in our practice, we reviewed our own experience and assessed the likely impact of that change and I'll present that experience today.
The paper which first drew our attention to this possibility was that of Fitzpatrick in nineteen eighty six.
He looked at four fourteen patients, with  well differentiated on the basis of tumours, and found that both number of tumours and size of tumours were significant in determining the likelihood of recurrence.
He also found that pati eighty percent of patients who had a negative three month cystoscopy never had another recurrence in the remainder of their follow up.
Conversely, only ten percent of patients who had recurrence at that three month cystoscopy went on to have no further recurrence in the remainder of the follow up.
Several other ones  issue in a number of different ways.
Palmer looked at three hundred and five patients, in an M R C study, and from a multivariate analysis, he found the number of tumours from that diagnosis was the single most  feature.
The size and the result of the three month check cystoscopy were also of considerable importance.
Morgan in nineteen ninety one took a hundred and seventy patients again found the number of tumours at diagnosis to be most important.
Then he looked specifically at the effect of the results of the three month or si six month cystoscopies, but they did note that only those pa only those patients who had recurrence in the first year went on to progressive stage.
And the final paper of, of these.
Prout in nineteen ninety two  a hundred and seventy patients and again found the number of tumours  the most important feature.
The size was also important, but only in those patients who had single tumours at presentation.
Despite these, this data, there seems to be little evidence yet of any change in common practice of three month check cystoscopies in the first year, six monthly in the second year, and yearly checks thereafter.
The papers I've mentioned did make some suggestions, in particular Palmer, in his paper recommended that if the patient had a single tumour presentation and a negative three month cystoscopy, then subsequent cystoscopy could be performed yearly.
Kent performed a mathematical analysis to determine the optimum follow up erm regime, and for patients with well differentiated non-invasive tumours, and no recurrence in the first year, he recommended a nine monthly regime.
And finally Morgan, looking again at solitary well differentiated tumours, suggested a regime similar to that of Palmer's, namely missing out two or three of the check cystoscopies in the first year.
We felt from this that there was, there was reasonable evidence to introduce this programme into our practice, and we, we looked at our patients erm at  and  , and we looked at all patients who'd had moderately or well-differentiated transition cell carcinoma of the bladder at diagnosis, a non-invasive tumour, small, solitary, with a minimum follow up of one year.
We didn't routinely measure or weigh our bladder tumours over this time, erm we have excluded any patient, any patient where the weight was recorded to be over ten grammes, and similarly any patient wh where it was recorded that the diameter was greater than three centimetres.
And we've also excluded those patients where the surgeon recorded that it was a large, extensive tumour.
We excluded patients with carcinoma sutch or  tumours at diagnosis.
We divided our patients into three groups, depending on the results of the three month check cystoscopy.
Group one had no recurrence at the three months.
Group two had recurrence at the site of the original tumour, and group three had recurrence elsewhere in the bladder.
We calculated the recurrence rate using the formula here, the number of cystoscopies at which recurrences were found divided the total length of follow up in months, and multiplied by a hundred to produce a convenient figure.
And this is what we found.
We identified a hundred and forty one patients who fitted the criteria at the diagnosis.
The mean age was sixty three, and the male to female ratio was approximately three to one.
The maximum length of follow up was twenty six years.
Group one, which is the patients we're particularly interested in, there are ninety two patients here, and eighty percent of them, seventy four patients, had no recurrence in the first year.
There were eighteen patients who had recurrence, twenty percent of patients who did have recurrence in the first year, and we've subdivided those, labelling seven patients protocol violators.
These were patients who missed the one or more check cystoscopies in that first year, and went on to have recurrence when they were next cystoscopied.
The mean recurrence rate for this group overall was one point nine five.
There were forty nine patients who had recurrences  at, at the three month cystoscopy.
Erm and the recurrence rates were considerably increased at eight point one and nine point three.
And this does tend to add weight to the suggestion that the result of the three month cystoscopy is a good guide to the likelihood of developing recurrence.
Looking at recurrences a little closer, of the eighteen patients, fifty percent only had a solitary recurrence in that first year, and no patient had more than four recurrences.
Of the protocol violators, those seven patients who missed out a cystoscopy and then had recurrences, six have only had occasional recurrences during the remainder of their follow up, and one required  chemotherapy four years from diagnosis, when he developed multiple superficial recurrences.
If we implemented this protocol on these patients, we would certainly be leaving these eighteen patients with small tumours in their bladder for several months longer than would previously have been the case.
Now we don't know the long term effect of that, but the experience with the protocol violators suggests that they won't come to any great harm, but obviously the number is small.
One patient in the whole series went on erm to progress to muscle invasive disease.
He was in group three.
That is, he had tumour elsewhere in the bladder at his three month cystoscopy, and no patient has died of bladder cancer from these hundred and forty one patients.
To summarize, for a well flagged group of patients, with small solitary non-invasive transition cell carcinomas at d at diagnosis, and negative three month cystoscopy, we found eighty percent of our patients would certainly have come to no harm at all if their second cystoscopy had been one year from diagnosis.
Twenty percent of our patients would have had recurrence in that year, but on the basis of our experience, we think it unlikely they would have come to any great harm, as a result of having their cystoscopy delayed, and we would recommend this protocol to the management of superficial bladder cancer.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think what we should do, as we've got two papers on similar topics, is er  take any questions that are specifically related to the t to this paper and the, the methods used in this paper, and then after the next paper have, have both speakers up to address the topic er of er of timing of follow up cystoscopies.
Are there any questions now that we would like to ask?
light on the auditorium.
Dazzle us a little less, so that we can see .
Right.
Can I just ask you, your protocol violators who 
Mm.
should have come back but didn't,
Yes.
did any of them have symptoms during that time when they had recurrences, that brought them back?
I don't think they did, no.
No.
They all just came back for a regular routine follow up, just a little bit late.
Right.
Well, let's assume you're saving the questions for after the second paper.
Shall we now move on to er the next paper, The Better Use of a Check Cystoscopy , by Steve .

Right, good morning, has everybody got two handouts, one called  can you all hear me okay?
Oh, it's the first time I've used one of these so  you should have two handouts, one called Advocacy Guide, one called Advocacy Criteria Guide.
Has everybody got t those two handouts?
Okay, a couple of  before we start.
If you haven't picked up these two handbooks that are on the table outside, can you do so some time today, okay?
So by the end of today make sure you've got those.
Also, just a reminder, next week you won't have a lecture at this time.
Your lecture will be at eleven o'clock, that's for next Monday.
Right, some of you know me, some of you don't.
For those who don't, my name is .
Erm, and I'm going to be talking to you this morning about advocacy.
Now, you may not realize it but you've been in civil litigation and criminal litigation, you've been doing advocacy all term.
Because what is advocacy?
Presentation, collection of information, preparation of information.
It's not just standing in court.
Advocacy is the skill of good presentation and information, and that starts on the day that you first interview a client.
It goes on when you're actually preparing statements, affidavits, pleadings, all those things which will eventually be used in court.
It's not just the end result of standing up in court and representing a client.
But this part of the course that we're specifically calling advocacy will concentrate on that part of the skill of advocacy, of the actual standing up and presenting information.
Why do you need to know advocacy skills?
One of the reasons is because the Law Society says you've got to have advocacy skills, and you'll find in your manual the actual amount or degree of advocacy skills you will eventually have to learn.
This is what you might call phase one within the L P C.
Phases two and three you will have during your training contracts.
Some of you might be thinking, well, I'm never going to advocate, I never intend to go anywhere near a court.
Even if you don't, the skill of advocacy, the skill of thinking concisely, presenting clearly, is a useful skill even if you never actually use it in the courtroom.
In meetings, in presentations of all kinds, the skill is useful.
Those of you going into large practices may think well, I'll never advocate, counsel will do it, but times are changing.
Large practices are more and more expecting their solicitors to do their own advocacy, and not instruct counsel.
Some large practices are beginning to put themselves forward as specialist advocates for smaller firms who can't specialize in that way.
So whichever sort of practice you're going into, you may at some point be required to advocate in some sort of court setting.
As I mentioned, you've been getting some advocacy experience, although you might not have realized it, in litigation already.
When it comes to the summer in your options that you take there, you will to a lesser or greater extent get some more advocacy experience during the summer.
But we're concentrating this week and next week on the advocacy skill of standing up before a court.
What's advocacy about?
Is it just the contents?
Is it the presentation of information?
Or are there lots of other things that you need to be aware of?
This is the impact that a speaker has when they stand up and speak to a group of people.
Only seven percent of the words that they speak, of their impact, based on the words they speak, thirty eight percent is based on their voice and the way that they present that information.
Fifty five percent are all the other messages that you're giving out, by the way you stand, the way you dress etcetera.
So when you think about when you're preparing for your advocacy exercises, the actual content that you prepare, although important, is not going to have the maximum impact.
The maximum impact is going to come from the way you stand, lots of other things, the way you speak  that's based on various studies that were done.
They weren't on court settings so I would imagine in a court situation perhaps the impact of words is slightly higher, you might expect, but it's still going to be a low percentage in respect of the overall conta image that's put over.
So when you are preparing, you need to think about the words you use.
They need to be clear, they need to be simple words, they don't need to be complex ones, because you've got to put over what you're saying very clearly.
To be effective you've got to structure the information that you give.
You will be getting scenarios and you won't be expected to put all that information over in one block, you're expected to structure your information.
You also need to develop a persuasive line of argument and we'll come back to those things later on.
So let's consider for a moment  what are the attributes, the other attributes, that an advocate needs?
I'm just going to put the video on for a moment   Thank you.
I'm sorry, it stops before the jokes start.
I'm afraid no matter how good your advocacy performance is, you're never going to get an ovation like that, and we won't expect you to do it in front of that size of audience either.
So the reason I put Jasper Carrott up here is just to think for a moment, here's somebody who's obviously a really effective and great communicator.
But could you send Jasper Carrott out to court ?
Okay, then you would all agree, you've got to put him through the old P C course.
Why can't you
why can't you send him down to court?
What have you got to change about him?
His coat, yes.
So the way he's, isn't it the way he's dressed for that is fine, but you can't send him down to court like that.
The er facial expressions are perhaps over the top for court?
Sorry, the unedited version   Right, so what have you got, what have you got to change about him?
What have we got to change about ourselves?
We've got to think about the way we dress.
Dress is not going to be compulsory
Well, dear, I suppose you really would make an impact then wouldn't you?
Erm  but we won't, well we're not going to be descriptive, we're not going to ask say that you must wear suits or you must whatever.
But our experience is that this sort of ad this sort of presentation  interviewing those sorts of things, they're very different forms of presentation.
But this form of presentation, which needs to be quite formal, what other students have found is that if you dress formally actually it helps you to act formally, because this sort of presentation is going to be very different.
Right, so what are we going to ch we're going to change the way he dresses, we're going to change the mannerisms, various things like that.
One of the things you, you've got to do is get used to actually talking standing up and the first thing you do you find when you s talk standing up is you discover that you've got hands.
I talk with my hands.
Many people talking with their hands.
And you've got feet, and you move around.
And you've got hair that falls in your face and you sort of, and all those things you've got to learn to cope with because if you're worried about what you're doing with your hands, or your feet, or your hair, then you can't then concentrate on putting over your information effectively.
So when you're practising  bail application, and I'll talk about that in a moment, think about what you're going to do, how you're going to stand.
Those of you who saw  today will know that he calls this position the Adam and Eve position.
And then there's the Prince Philip position.
Or there's holding, anything, that keeps your hands under control.
If you know you tend to talk with your hands, how're you gonna keep them under control?
The other thing that tends to throw people the first time they every do ad advocacy is that you're going to talk to somebody who will not talk to you, who will not s possibly even smile at you, who won't give you the usual feedback that we're u that we're used to when we're talking to someone.
So be prepared for that, be prepared that the person you're going to talk to is not gonna give you that usual to and fro feedback and don't be thrown by that.
Preparing, try not to use scripts.
When you're preparing what you're going to say, use notes, and I've given you some guidance in the handout on using notes.
Why not use a script?
Because if you're speaking from a script you're going to be speaking like this.
You can't make eye contact if you're speaking to a piece of paper.
You can't be persuasive if you're speaking to a piece of paper, if you're reading from a script.
Also, what you generally find is that if somebody is reading as opposed to refreshing their memory from looking at a piece of paper and then letting it flow, if they're reading from it it's dull, it lacks sparkle.
The words may be brilliant, the sentences may be perfectly constructed but it hasn't got that life in it that the more spontaneous talking will have, and it's less persuasive.
Those of you who've done some advocacy before may have used lecterns.
You will not be getting lecterns this time around.
The reason we've elected not to give you lecterns is you'll never get lecterns in real life.
If you go into a real court there aren't lecterns.
So you've got to get used to advocating with just an ordinary table, and how do you do that?
How do you cope with that?
Again, if you're going to be using notes, you don't want to be talking down to a table, so think about whether you're s you're going to, in your practising, are you going to let your eyes flick down to your notes that're on the paper, on the table, or are you gonna pick them up?
Are you going to just have them in front of you so you can flick your eyes up and down to remind yourself what you're next going to say?
Don't hold them too far up.
Remember in your content that you're representing a client.
The court isn't really concerned about your views, it's concerned about your client and the argument you can formulate for the client that you're representing.
Be realistic about your client's position.
Don't try to paint a picture of your client being the perfect citizen if he's not the perfect citizen.
The other thing to remember, you're trying to persuade the court to your views, or the view that you're putting forward for your client, you're not telling the court what they must think.
You're putting over information on the basis that the only thing that a t an intelligent person think  I'm saying to you now, what's going to be the effect of that on the listener?
If somebody says you must think this, the only way of doing it is, that's not going to be persuasive.
So you've got to think in terms of persuasion.
Right, what are we going to expect you to do?
The first exercise you're doing is a bail application.
And the timetable for that will be going out on the, the noticeboard some time this afternoon.
Now some of you will be doing your bail application on Wednesday and some on Friday.
Because, and you'll be given the instructions for those in your small group sessions today.
Because the, we can't put all of you into, that're doing advocacy into one small group session, you may find yourselves with a different tutor, or at a different time, to when you would normally have your small group session.
So be careful to make sure you find your number on the timetable and know where you're going and who you're going to be with.
Also, you're going to be doing it in fours, so four will you, four of you will arrive at the beginning of the session, and four of you will arrive half way through.
And those of you who ar who arrive half way through will need to wait outside.
All the times that you need to arrive at you will find on the timetable.
The first session is designed to be one that gives y gets you accustomed to advocacy, to be non-threatening, and to be one where you can simply literally find your feet and get used to advocating in that way.
You won't be given a great deal of feedback in that session, just enough to get you going.
The majority of the feedback you're going to get to help you find your advocacy skills will be after the supervised litigation that you'll do next week.
I think you were all given a timetable last Monday which showed where the various advocacy things are going to be.
So this week you'll do a three minute application, you'll see the way in which th that's going to be done from the instructions in the small group session that you'll get today.
Non-threatening, try and relax, just try and get used to standing on your feet.
It will be videoed, to se you'll make two applications within that small group session and a second will be videoed but only for you to see so that you can take it away and try and learn from er seeing yourself on video.
The second advocacy exercise is on that first er timetable called unsupervised mitigation.
You'll be given a ro a pair of you will be given a room on your own, and a video camera, and asked to practise advocacy skills plea in mitigation.
And the second ad the third advocacy will be the supervised mitigation when you'll do it with a tutor and then have separate individual feedback given to you.
When you come to the small group session this week, you'll need to bring with you your video tape.
Make sure it's at a point on the video tape where it can be recorded immediately because there won't be time to find the right point, and also make sure you bring with you a watch because you're going to need to be very tight on, on times, so try and remember to bring a watch with you.
All the pieces of advocacy that we're going to ask you to do are short.
Three or four minutes is all that we're going to ask you to do each time.
One of the reasons for that is that one of the skills of the advocate is to learn to be concise and to get over the message very quickly, and that's one of the reasons for giving you a short period of time.
The other thing that's available to you in making your preparation is a video of local practitioners.
It will be available from tomorrow morning.
You'll be able to borrow it from the office downstairs and view it in the library.
On that video you'll find three local practitioners.
They, on that video, are bill er bail applications, applications for plea in mitigation applications and three examples of how not to make an application before the court.
All three are very experienced advocates before the courts but all three of them have deliberately done one application wrong, so you can see the typical things that advocates do do that should not be done.
And I think, if you look at that video, it will actually perhaps encourage you because it sh yes, those are experienced advocates, I'm not expecting you to refine your skills to that level, but I think if you see the, the erm the level of which experienced advocates advocate at it will actually perhaps make you relax a little, if you see the stand realize that the standard we're expecting you to go to is not, not anywhere near quite as high as that.
I'm going to show you an excerpt now from that video.
The full video will be available tomorrow morning.
Please, your worship, this is a most unfortunate case.
My client's a young man of thirty six years of age.
He appears before the court for the first time for what is essentially a domestic assault on his girlfriend.
Perhaps I can give you some of the background to this particular matter.
My client and his girlfriend have been together for some six year, they have three children aged six, five and four.
They originally lived in the home counties but came up to this area two years ago.
Er, my client has been in business at the u his own firm supplying computer software in a specialized market, that is stock control systems for clubs, pubs and restaurants.
You can imagine this has meant him working very long hours, one of the other problems he has is he suffers from diabetes.
Working long hours also means that er he also gets very tired and, as he now acknowledges, when he's tired he tends to be short-tempered.
That then is the background to this particular incident.
Because of his working hours he is not giving as much time as he ought perhaps to his family, although he's always tried to ensure that weekends are devoted to his children.
When this incident occurred he'd been working on a project in Harlow in Essex setting up another system.
This had entailed him working long hours.
On the Friday before the incident occurred he had not got home until three o'clock in the morning.
He'd then had to drive back down to Harlow again the following morning to sort out further problems with the system.
Returning about tea time, he'd then gone out once more to deliver some computer disks for another project he was running in Heanor.
He returned home about eight o'clock in the evening, feeling absolutely exhausted, and as he said, all he wanted to do was go to sleep.
There had been problems in his relationship with his girlfriend and indeed he'd come to see my firm about six months ago because of the deterioration in that relationship and had general advice then about his legal position should there be a separation.
He had not come back after he had been given general advice, and he had what he describes as an uneasy peace in the relationship with his girlfriend.
She was insistent in case there should be a separation that he should make some form of, of proper financial arrangement for them, a legally binding agreement.
When he returned home very tired on the Saturday evening she turned on him and began nagging him again about the possibility of a separation and that he should make proper commitment to her.
Unfortunately, in the course of that discussion, he lost his temper with her, there was a struggle and she suffered some minor bruises and scratches.
The police were called, my client was arrested and was detained at the police station from about midnight on the Saturday until eventually he appeared before the court about four o'clock on the Monday afternoon.
He'd been in custody there for nearly thirty six hours altogether.
He was then released on bail and, as is the custom, the police required conditions of his bail that he should not go back to his girlfriend's address to prevent any possibility of any further offending.
He therefore has been living with friends, sleeping on their floors, for the last few weeks, because he's complied explicitly with the conditions of his bail.
He's therefore not been able to contact his girlfriend, he's not been able to see his children, er, although he has missed them very much.
He now says that he does love his girlfriend, he does want to make that relationship work, and he's very hopeful of making a reconciliation.
Madam may feel that having spent so much time in custody for the first offence that he has already suffered sufficient punishment, he's been kept away from his girlfriend and children, and under those circumstances I would urge you Madam to take a lenient course of action, to make him the subject of a conditional discharge.
Apart from anything else, that'll ensure the court that he is not tempted to be involved in any similar incident in the future with is girlfriend.
And Madam, I'd also ask you to say that to  to him to pay compensation for the minor injuries she's suf she's suffered and of course you have to consider that's a point in a case involving assault, would be to add insult to injury, and would not assist the parties in coming to terms with their relationship and hopefully attempting a reconciliation.
Right, so  is a very experienced advocate.
If you can get it as good as that your first time up you must be a natural.
Cos if you notice, hardly any moving around, if you think about  had a go and think about , the dress is different, the manner is different, the voice is different, very little facial expression even, certainly very little movement, but good eye contact.
The whole of the way through that he was looking at the person he was trying to im not staring at them, but good eye contact, so if you're trying to influence somebody there's no point in looking somewhere else.
You look at that person.
Let's have a look at how  deliberately did this one wrong.
Please your worships, I appear on behalf of Mr Smith this morning.
He's a man of er of previous good character.
He's er, he's er, twenty er no thirty six years of age, thirty six years of age Madam.
He appears before the court for the first time, he's of previous good character and erm and er has never been in trouble with the courts before and er Madam I'm going to suggest to you that this incident was brought about not by any fault of his own, but, but by his girlfriend and her behaviour towards him.
I ask you to deal him leniently in that because of that.
Madam, my client's thirty six years of age and lives with his girlfriend.
He has been working very long hours setting up in business here in er in this area er he gets home late at night and I'm afraid to say that over the last few months he's been nagged continuously by his girlfriend who wants him to try and sort out financial arrangements because the relationship between the two of them's not been very good.
He comes home late night, one Saturday night, having been working long hours, not having enough sleep, she nags him and Madam he loses his temper with her and Madam, I am sure that you and I in our relationships   same sort of stress in a different situation where, where we've been nagged by our partners and lost our temper and pushed them about, or whatever, and we'd be very surprised I think to find ourselves in, in my client's situation had that happened, because what, what happened here Madam was that erm the girlfriend suffered some minor injuries, nothing to worry about really  .
I think Madam yeah she complains Madam of er scratches to her arms and bruises to her upper arms where he allegedly grabbed hold of her erm and that really is it, nothing to worry about at all.
sort this out sensibly, the police overreact, they arrest him at midnight in the clothes he stands up in, they take him down to the police station, he's held in the police station for about thirty six hours or so, something like that, er instead of being brought before the court straight away and released on bail straight away, they, they keep him in custody where he's never been before, er and Madam he's then released on bail but court imposes silly conditions on him, conditions that he shouldn't go back to his home address, he can't go and see his girlfriend, he can't go and see his children, er, and Madam it seems to be an abuse of the process really of the court to behave in this way.
He's therefore been stuck, living on er friends' floors for the last few weeks, not being able to go back to his girlfriend and not being able to see his children, er and Madam that's had an effect on his, on his business as well.
So Madam I'm asking you to say that these circumstances, this is the sort of case that should never have come before the court, it should've been sorted out between the parties themselves, with the aid of their solicitors, and that it's only the overreaction of the police in this particular circumstance that brings him before the court here.
He's got no previous convictions.
Madam, I'm gonna ask you to say in those circumstances that we should give him the maximum discharge.
You appreciate that means he has no, effectively no record at all and that seems to me to balance up what's happened here against er against the fact that he's got no previous convictions Madam.
I think to impose any other penalty upon him would merely be to exacerbate the situation.
He's suffered enough.

*CHI:	I can't tell ya.
*CHI:	ya gotta guess.
*MEL:	you're full of secrets today.
*CHI:	the one that said somethin'.
"I don't reckon they can ship, 'cause most on 'em belongs to the Tallahatchie, and they can't leave."
"That's so," shouted several of the group, including some of the crew of the Bellevite.
"What's the Talla-what-you-call-her?" demanded Christy.
"She's the steamer you can see when the fog lifts," answered Captain Sullendine. "The Tallahatchie is her name. Are you a sailor, my lively lad?"
"I reckon I know the bobstay from the mainmast."
"You know sumthin about my mate and men, my jolly tar, and I'll give you five dollars apiece for any news on 'em that will help me to ketch 'em; and I'll ship you into the bargain, for I want more hands," the captain proceeded in a more business-like manner, though at the expense of his oratory.
Just at this moment three short and sharp whistles sounded from off the shore, and about half of the skipper's audience turned upon their heels and walked down to the water, where they embarked in a boat. They were evidently members of the ship's company of the Tallahatchie, on shore on leave, and the whistles were the signal for their return. The remainder of the group, with two or three exceptions, were the seamen of the blockader.
"Where'd you come from, my hearty?" demanded the captain of the schooner, turning to Christy again.
"I was tooken in a blockader, eight on us. We done stole a whaleboat and comed ashore," replied Christy, enlarging upon the story he had told the bivouackers.
"Eight on you!" exclaimed the master of the schooner. "Where's the rest on ye?"
"They're all about here somewhar, and I reckon I kin find em. They're lookin for sunthin t'eat. They all want to ship, and the mate of the Rattler's one on 'em," continued Christy, guiding himself by the circumstances as they were developed to him.
"What's your name, my man?"
"My name's Jerry Sandman; and I ain't ashamed on't."
"Are your men all sailors, Jerry?"
"Every one on 'em."
"I want eight good men, Jerry, the mate bein' one on 'em."
"Then we kin fix you like a 'possum in a hole."
"I've got two boats on the shore; the deserters stole one on 'em, and I come ashore in t'other arter 'em. I reckon I'll get a steamer in Nassau, and I want all the good men I can find to man her. I'll ship the whole on you. Find your men, Jerry, and fetch 'em down to the boats. I'll give 'em all sumthin t'eat. Now be lively about it," said Captain Sullendine, as he walked away towards the shore.
"I'll find 'em in no time," replied Christy, as he removed his soft hat with his left hand, and scratched his head with the other.
The rest of the party scattered, and Graines joined the lieutenant.
CHAPTER VII
A POWERFUL ALLY OF THE BELLEVITERS
The seamen of the Bellevite had listened with intense interest to the conversation between the commander of the West Wind and the lieutenant; and there was not a single one of them who did not comprehend the purpose of the chief of the expedition. They were greatly amused at the manner in which Christy conducted himself, and especially at the mongrel dialect he had used. It was a little difficult for them to realize that the awkward fellow who was in conversation with the skipper of the schooner was the gentlemanly, well-spoken officer they had been accustomed to see on the quarter-deck of the Bellevite.
They separated as they had been instructed to do; but they were careful not to go to any great distance from the spot, for they understood that they should be wanted in a few minutes. Graines had not spoken a word on this occasion, though he had done most of the talking at the bivouac. He was ready to do his part; but the skipper had addressed his companion first, introducing the subject, and he had no opportunity to get in a single word.
"I suppose you understand it all, Charley," said Christy as soon as they were alone.
"I could not very well have helped doing so if I had tried. The only thing that bothered me was when you appeared to be betraying yourself by alluding to the mate," replied Graines.
"I did not do that by accident; but I desired to get the whole attention of the captain, and I got it. The rest all followed in due course. Now tell all the men to go down to the shore, and wait a little distance from the two boats till you and I join them. Tell them all to be hungry. Your name is Mr. Balker, the mate of the Rattler, the blockade-runner from which we escaped in a whaleboat. My name is Jerry Sandman, the second mate, for the want of a better. Tell them not to forget any of these names," continued Christy.
"They heard the whole story, and they were deeply interested in it, for they could not help seeing what was coming," added the engineer, as he went to carry out the order he had just received.
The seamen still kept together in pairs, and Graines instructed them by twos, impressing them with the necessity of remembering the names they had heard in the lieutenant's story, which was a "story" in the double sense of the word. As each couple received their lesson, they sauntered in the direction of the shore.
"What's going to be done, Mr. Graines?" asked French, who was one of the second pair the engineer instructed.
"That is none of your business, French. You are to remember the names I have given you, and then obey orders," replied Graines rather sharply, for it was a very unusual thing for a seaman, or even an officer, to ask such a question of his superior; and the discipline of the Bellevite was as exacting as it was kind and fatherly.
"Excuse me, Mr. Graines; I only wanted to be ready for whatever was coming," pleaded French.
"Excused; but don't ask such questions. You listened to the conversation between your officer and the captain of the schooner; and if you cannot comprehend the meaning of it, ask Lines, and he will explain it," added the engineer, "Where are Londall and Vogel?"
"Right by that pile of rubbish, sir," replied French, as he led the way to the shore.
The last pair were instructed and sent with the others, and they asked no questions. Graines joined the lieutenant, who had seated himself on a log, and reported that all was going on right.
"As I said before, Charley, you will be the mate of the Rattler, and will no doubt be engaged for the same position on board of the West Wind. I will ship as second mate, if one of the two men now on board of the vessel is not shipped as such, for I wish to be among the men," said Christy, after looking about him to see that no one was within hearing distance of them.
"I take it I shall not make a long voyage as mate," replied Graines.
"Probably not, though I cannot tell how long you will have to serve in that capacity. I purpose to have the Tallahatchie tow the schooner as far down as practicable; but we shall doubtless have business on our hands before it is time to cut the towline. Now we will wait upon the captain."
They found him walking up and down the shore, apparently somewhat excited; and doubtless he had not entire confidence in the promises of "Jerry Sandman." The six seamen had not joined Captain Sullendine on the shore, but had placed themselves behind a coal shanty quite near the water.
"I've brought the mate down, Cap'n Sull'dine," Christy began, as he and the engineer halted in front of the master of the schooner. "Here he is, an' I reckon there ain't no better sailor in the great Confed'racy. This yere is Mr. Balker."
"How are ye, Mr. Balker? You are just the man I want more'n I want my supper. Now tell me something about yourself."
Graines invented a story suited to the occasion. Then the conversation was about wages; and the candidate haggled for form's sake, but finally accepted the lay the captain offered.
"By the way, Captain Sullendine, do you happen to have a second mate?" asked the engineer when the terms were arranged.
"I had one; but he run away with Bird Riley. He wa'n't good for nothin', and I'm glad he's gone," replied the skipper.
"The man you talked with is Jerry Sandman, and he was the other mate of the Rattler. He isn't a showy fellow, but he was a first-class second mate," continued Graines.
"Then I ship him as second mate;" and they arranged the wages without much difficulty.
The six seamen were promptly shipped. The whole party then embarked in the two boats, Captain Sullendine dividing them into two parties for the purpose. The fog had settled down very densely upon the shore; but the West Wind was easily found, and they went on board, where one boat was hoisted up to the stern davits, and the other on the port quarter.
"Here you be, Mr. Balker," said Captain Sullendine when the party reached the quarter-deck; and he was so lively in his movements, and so glib in his speech, as to provoke the suspicion that he had imbibed again at the conclusion of his oration on shore. "Here, you, Sopsy!" he continued in a loud voice.
A lantern was burning on the companion, which enabled the party to see that the waist of the vessel was compactly packed with bales of cotton. The schooner seemed to be of considerable size, and Christy thought she must be loaded with a very large cargo of the precious merchandise. In answer to the captain's call, Sopsy, who proved to be the negro cook of the vessel, presented himself.
"All these people want something to eat, Sopsy. Let the crew eat in the deck-house for'ad, and bring a lunch into the cabin right off," continued Captain Sullendine.
"Yis, sar," replied the cook with emphasis. "Git 'em quicker'n a man kin swaller his own head. Libes dar a man wid soul so dead"--
"Never mind the varse, Sopsy," interposed the captain.
"--As never to hisself have said"--
"Hurry up, Sopsy!"
"He don't say dat, Massa Cap'n," added the cook, as he shuffled off over the bales of cotton.
"Hullo there, Bokes! Where are you, Bokes?" called the captain again.
"On deck, Cap'n," replied a white man, crawling out from a small opening in the bales.
"Wake up, Bokes! You ain't dead yet."
"No, sir; wide awake's a coon in a hencoop," added the man, who appeared to be one of the two left on board by the deserters, the cook being the other.
"Be alive, Bokes! Here, wait a minute!" and the captain ran down the companion ladder to the cabin, from which he presently appeared with a bottle in each hand. "Do you see them men on the cotton, Bokes?" he asked, pointing with one of them at the six Belleviters, who stood where they had taken their stations after hoisting up the quarter-boat.
"I see sunthin over thar," replied the seaman, who seemed to be hardly awake yet.
"Them's the new crew I shipped to-night--six on 'em, or seven with the second mate," added the captain. "Show 'em over to the deck-house, and let 'em pick out their bunks."
"Seven on 'em; the cook and me makes nine, and they ain't but eight berths in the deck-house, Cap'n," replied Bokes, who seemed to be afraid of losing his own sleeping quarters.
"You can sleep on the deck, then. These are all good men, and they must have good berths," added the captain. "You can sleep as well in the scuppers as anywhere else, Bokes; and you ain't more'n half awake any time."
"Must have my berth, Cap'n, or I go ashore," persisted the seaman.
"Small loss anyhow," growled the captain.
"How is the cabin, Captain Sullendine?" interposed Graines.
"Two staterooms and four berths," replied the master.
"Then why can't the second mate take one of the berths in the cabin?" suggested the new mate. "He is a first-rate fellow, and I reckon he's a better sailor than I am, for he's been to sea about all his life."
"'Tain't reg'lar to have the second mate in the cabin. He'll have t'eat with us if he bunks there," argued the master.
"He'll have to keep his watch on deck when we eat, and I reckon he'll have to take his grub alone," reasoned the mate.
"I'd ruther live in the deck-house with the crew," said Christy.
"But there ain't no room thar," added Graines, who thought his superior had made the remark simply to keep up his character.
"Let him come into the cabin, then," said Captain Sullendine, in order to settle the question. "Now, Bokes, take this apple-jack, and show the other six to the deck-house. Give 'em one or two drinks all round. It'll do 'em good."
Bokes obeyed the order, after the master had lighted another lantern for his use, and he went over the bales of cotton to the seamen.
Captain Sullendine remarked with great complacency that he always treated his men well, gave them enough to eat and drink, and he thought the apple-jack he had sent them would do them good. He liked to be liberal with his crew, for he believed a tot of grog would go further with them than "cussin' 'em;" and the two mates did not gainsay him, though they believed in neither grog nor "cussin'."
Though Christy never drank a drop of intoxicating fluid under any circumstances, and Graines almost never, both of them believed that "apple-jack" had been a very serviceable ally during the night so far. Rut they considered it useful only in the hands of the enemy, and they were sorry to see the bottles sent forward for the use of Belleviters; for they were afraid some of them might muddle and tangle their brains with the fiery liquor.
"Come, mates, let's go down into the cabin now," continued the captain, descending the ladder without waiting for them.
"I will go forward for a few minutes, Charley," whispered Christy in the ear of the engineer, who followed the captain below.
When the lieutenant reached the deck-house he found the men there, with Bokes in the act of taking a long pull at one of the bottles, while French was holding the other.
"Here's the second mate," said the seaman with the bottle.
"You can keep the bottle you have, Bokes," said Christy. "Now go aft with it." The sleepy sailor was willing enough to obey such a welcome order, and the lieutenant took the other bottle to the side and emptied it into the water. The men did not object, and the new second mate joined the master in the cabin.
CHAPTER VIII
ON BOARD OF THE COTTON SCHOONER
Probably some, if not all, of the six men in the deck-house of the West Wind were in the habit of taking intoxicating liquors when they were ashore, and when it was served out on board of the ship in conformity with the rules and traditions of the navy. The commander and his executive officer labored for the promotion of total abstinence among the officers and crew. More than the usual proportion of the men commuted their "grog ration" for money, through the influence of the principal officers.
While the commander of the present expedition accepted the aid of the powerful ally, "apple-jack," in the service of his country, drinking freely appeared to him to be about the same thing as going over to the enemy; and he could not permit his men to turn traitors involuntarily, when he knew they would not do so of their own free will and accord. He had settled the liquor question to his own satisfaction in the deck-house, returning the bottle to French.
When Graines went below, a minute or two later than Captain Sullendine, he saw his new superior in the act of tossing off another glass of whiskey, as he concluded it was from the label on the bottle which stood on the cabin table. He had been considerably exhilarated before, and he was in a fair way to strengthen the ally of the loyalists by carrying his powerful influence to the head of the commander of the intending blockade-runner. The captain seated himself at the table, and Christy saw that he had a flat bottle in his breast-pocket.
"Now, Mr. Balker, we had better seal up the bargain we've made with forty drops from this bottle," said he, as he poured out a glass for himself, regardless of the fact that he had just indulged; and at the same time he pushed the bottle and another glass towards the new mate.
Graines covered the lower part of the glass with his hand, and poured a few drops into it. Putting some water with it from the pitcher, he raised the tumbler in imitation of the captain.
"Here's success to the right side," added the master, as he drank off the contents of the glass.
"I drink that toast with all my mind, heart, and soul," added the engineer, with decided emphasis, though he knew that "the right side" did not always convey the same idea.
"Help yourself, Mr.-- I've forgot your name, Second Mate," he added as he moved towards the companion ladder.
"Jerry Sandman, sir, and I will help myself to what I want," replied Christy.
"That's right, Mr. Sandman; make yourself at home in this cabin. I must go on deck and take a look at the Tallahatchie," added the master as he went up the ladder, followed by Graines.
The lieutenant helped himself to a glass of water, after rinsing the tumbler, for that was what he wanted. Sopsy the cook immediately appeared, bearing a tray on which were several dishes of eatables, bread and ham being the principal. The bottle was in his way; and after he had drunk off half a tumblerful of its contents, he removed it to the pantry. He proceeded to set the table.
"Oft in der chizzly night, 'fore slumber's yoke hab tooken me," hummed Sopsy as he worked at the table.
"Where is this schooner bound, Sopsy?" asked Christy.
"Bound to dat boon whar no trab'ler returns," replied the cook, pausing in his occupation and staring the second mate full in the face.
"That bourn is Nassau, I reckon," laughed the lieutenant.
"I s'pose she's gwine dar if she don't go to dat boon where no trab'lers come back agin," answered Sopsy seriously. "Be you Meth'dis' o' Bab'tis', Massa Mate?"
"Both, Sopsy."
"Can't be bof, Massa."
"Then I'm either one you like."
"That ain't right, Massa Secon' Mate, 'cordin' as you was brung up," said the cook, shaking his head violently, as though he utterly disapproved of the mate's theology.
"I'm a theosophist, Sopsy."
"A seehossofist!" exclaimed the cook, dropping a plate in his astonishment. "We don't hab none o' dem on shore in de Souf. I reckon dey libs in de water."
"No; they live on the mountains."
"We hain't got no mount'ns down here, and dat's de reason we don't hab none on 'em," added Sopsy as he went to the pantry; but presently returned with a plate of pickles in one hand and the whiskey bottle in the other. "Does dem sea-hosses drink whisker, Massa Secon' Mate?"
"They never drink a drop of it."
"Dis colored pusson ain't no sea-hoss, and he do drink whiskey when he kin git it," added the cook; and he half filled a tumbler with the contents of the bottle, and drank it off at a single gulp.
He had hardly placed it on the table in the middle of the dishes before the captain came below. His first step was to take a liberal potation from the bottle. As he raised it to the swinging lamp, he discovered that the fluid had been freely expended in his absence.
"You've punished this bottle all it deserves," said he when he perceived that its level had been considerably lowered, and he did not ask the new officer to join him. "That's all right, Mr. Sandman; but I don't want you to take more than you can manage to-night, for we have a big job on our hands, and we want our heads where we shall be able to find them. Now go on deck, and learn what you can about the vessel, for we hain't got but half an hour more before the Tallahatchie goes to sea. We may have lots of music after we get outside; but I reckon our steamer can outsail anything the Yankees have got on the blockade. Don't drink no more, Mr. Sandman; and when we git to Nassau you can have a reg'lar blowout."
"I won't touch another drop before we get out of the bay, Cap'n Sullendine," protested Christy, without betraying the misdemeanor of the cook, as doubtless it was.
"That's right, Mr. Sandman; we must all have our heads on our shoulders to-night," said the captain, as he drank off the potion he had prepared.
Christy wished to hold the commander to his own advice; but that would have been fighting on the wrong side for him, and Sopsy escaped a reprimand, if not a kick or two, by his forbearance. By this time the bottle was nearly empty; but the skipper put it under lock and key in a closet, which seemed to be well filled with others like it. Christy went on deck, in obedience to the order he had received, and found the engineer on the quarter-deck buried in the fog, which was just then more dense than at any time before.
"The captain's pretty well set 'up,' isn't he Christy?" said Graines in a low tone.
"About half seas over; but he knows what he is about, though he took another heavy potion just now," replied the lieutenant.
"All right; I think we can manage this craft very well without him," added Graines with a smile, which could not be seen in the darkness.
But the conversation was interrupted at this point by the appearance of the cook, whose legs were more tangled up by his tipples than his master's. He delivered the request of Captain Sullendine that they should come into the cabin, and partake of the lunch which had been set out for them. As they moved towards the companion, they saw Sopsy creep over to the alley where Bokes had been sleeping, and take up the bottle of apple-jack Christy had given him, and drink from it. It was evident to them that the cook could not be much longer in condition for any duty.
The two mates went below as invited, and found the captain at the table. He had brought out the bottle of whiskey, and was eating of the dishes before him, but plainly with little relish.
"Have another little drink, Mr. Balker; but I think Mr. Sandman had better not take anymore," said the master, whose speech was rather thick by this time.
"Thank you, Captain Sullendine; I will do a little in that way, for we are likely to have a very damp night of it," replied Graines, as he helped himself, though he did not take ten drops.
"A little does one good; but it don't do to take too much when we have very important business on our hands. After that one, Mr. Balker, I advise you not to take any more till we get clear of the blockaders," added the skipper, as he emptied the bottle into his glass.
The ham on the table was of excellent quality, and the two mates ate heartily of it, with the ship-bread. The last dose the captain had taken appeared to cap the climax, and he could no longer eat, or talk so as to be clearly understood. When the mates had finished their lunch, they saw that the skipper had dropped asleep in his chair. They rose from their places, and rattled the stools. The noise roused the sleeper, and he sprang to his feet with a violent start.
"What's time'z it, Mr. Zbalker?" he demanded, catching hold of the table to avoid falling on the cabin floor.
He seemed to be conscious that he was not presenting a perfectly regular appearance to his new officers; and he dropped into his chair, making a ludicrous effort to stiffen his muscles and put on his dignity, but it was a failure.
"Quarter-past two, Captain Sullendine," replied Graines in answer to the question.
"Most an hour more 'fore we git started," stammered the invalid. "I didn't sleep none last night, I'm sleepy. I'm go'n to turn in for half an hour, 'n then I'll be on deck ready for busi-- ready for buzness."
Graines assisted him to his stateroom, for he could not walk, and he was afraid he would fall and hurt himself. He helped him into his berth, and arranged him so that he could sleep it off, and he did not care if he did not do so before the next day. He waited till he had dropped off into a deep slumber, and then joined Christy in the cabin.
"If I had not been a temperance man before, I should be now," said the lieutenant. "It is just as well that the captain is clean over the bay, for we might have been obliged to shoot him if he had been sober."
"But we could have taken possession of the vessel in spite of him, if the steamer had not interfered," replied Graines, as he led the way to the deck. "I don't see that we have anything to do but wait for the moving of the waters, or for the moving of the steamer. I suppose our men are all right forward."
"I have no doubt of it, though I have not seen them lately. I gave one of the bottles of apple-jack the captain sent forward for them to Bokes, and poured the contents of the other into Mobile Bay. I think we had better go forward and look the vessel over," said Christy.
They had gone but a few steps before they stumbled over the body of Sopsy, who had evidently succumbed to the quantity of firewater he had consumed. He had assisted Bokes to empty the bottle given to him, and both of them were too far gone to give an alarm if they discovered at any time that something was wrong about the movements of the West Wind.
They found the Belleviters lounging about on the cotton bales, some of them asleep, and others carrying on a conversation in a low tone. They were glad to see their officers, who told them the time for some sort of action was rapidly approaching. Then they went to the bow of the vessel, where they found that she was anchored, though the chain had been hove short. The hawser by which she was to be towed to sea was made fast to the bowsprit bitts, and led to the stern of the steamer, where it was doubtless properly secured.
While they were looking over the bow, a boat approached from the Tallahatchie, and an officer hailed, asking for Captain Sullendine.
"He is in the cabin; I am the mate," replied the engineer, "and the captain has shipped a new crew, we are all right now."
"Weigh your anchor at three short whistles," added the officer.
"Understood, and all right," said the new mate.
The boat pulled back to the steamer.
CHAPTER IX
THE DEPARTURE OF THE TALLAHATCHIE
The fog, which had been coming and going during the whole of the night, had now lifted so that everything in the vicinity of the fort could be seen; but across the point, down the ship channel, it was dense, dark, and black. The wind was fresh from the south-west, which rolled up the fog banks, and then rolled them away. Such was the atmospheric condition near Mobile Point, and Christy believed it was the same at the southward. He thought it probable that the commander of the Tallahatchie would wait for a more favorable time than the present appeared to be before he got under way.
"All hands to the forecastle," he called to the men on the cotton bales.
All of them, knowing his voice as well as they knew their own names, hastened to answer to the call.
"We have to heave up the anchor with a windlass, Mr. Graines," said he to the engineer. "We had better get the hang of it while we have time to do so. Ship the handspikes, my men."
Doubtless all of them had worked a windlass before, for every one of them was an able seaman, which had been one of the elements in their selection, and they went to work very handily. A turn or two was given, which started the vessel ahead, showing that the anchor was not hove entirely short. Graines went to the bow, and reported a considerable slant of the cable with the surface of the water. Christy ordered the six seamen to work the windlass, with French to take in the slack. They continued to heave over with the handspikes for some time longer.
"Cable up and down, sir," reported Graines.
"Avast heaving!" added the lieutenant; and he had taken the command, paying no attention to the fact that he was the second mate under the new order of things, and the engineer did not remind him that he was the chief officer. "Let off the cable a couple of notches, so that the anchor will not break out. Make fast to the bitts, French, but don't foul it with the towline."
"We are all right now," said Graines, as he moved aft from the heel of the bowsprit.
"What time is it now?" asked the lieutenant. "Bring that lantern forward, Lines."
"Ten minutes of three," replied the engineer, holding his watch up to the light.
"The fog is settling down again, and I have no doubt the captain of the steamer will get under way at about the hour named," said Christy, putting his hand on the wire towline, and giving it a shake, to assure himself that it was all clear. "Now, Mr. Graines, or rather, Mr. Balker, as you are the mate and I am only the second mate, I think you had better go aft and see that all goes well there."
"Very well, Mr. Sandman; I will leave you in charge of the forecastle," replied the engineer, with a light laugh; but they had been boys together, and understood each other perfectly.
"Captain Sullendine is the only dangerous man on board, and I think you had better look after him," added Christy. "If there is any lock on the door of his stateroom, it would be well to turn the key."
"I will look after him at once, sir," answered Graines, as he leaped upon the cotton bales and made his way to the quarter-deck.
On the way he examined the condition of Sopsy, and found him snoring like a roaring lion, in an uneasy position. He turned him over on his side, and then went to the lair of Bokes, who was in the same condition; and he concluded that neither of them would come to his senses for a couple of hours at least.
Captain Sullendine had been assisted to a comfortable position when he turned in, and he was sleeping with nothing to disturb him. There was no lock on the door, and Graines could not turn the key. The interior of the cabin was finished in the most primitive manner, for the vessel had not been built to accommodate passengers. The door of the captain's stateroom was made of inch and a half boards, with three battens, and the handle was an old-fashioned bow-latch. There was a heavy bolt on the inside, as though the apartment had been built to enable the master to fortify himself in case of a mutiny.
The engineer could not fasten the door with any of the fixtures on it; but it opened inward, as is generally the case on shipboard, and this fact suggested to the ingenious officer the means of securing it even more effectually than it could have been done with a lock and key. In the pantry he found a rolling-pin, which the cook must have left there for some other purpose.
This implement he applied to the bow-handle of the fixture on the door. It would not fit the iron loop, but he whittled it down on one side with his pocket-knife till he made it fit exactly in its place with some hard pressure. But shaking the door might cause it to drop out, and he completed the job by lashing it to the handle of the door with a lanyard he had in his pocket. When he had finished his work he was confident the captain could not get out of his room unless he broke down the door, which he lacked the means to accomplish.
"West Wind, ahoy!" shouted some one from the stern of the steamer before the engineer had completed his work in the cabin.
Christy thought that French's voice was a better imitation of Captain Sullendine's than his own, and he directed him to reply to the hail, telling him what to say.
"On board the Tallahatchie!" returned the seaman at the lieutenant's dictation.
"Are you all ready?" shouted the same officer.
"All ready, sir!" replied French.
"Captain Rombold will get under way in five minutes!" called the speaker on the stern of the steamer. "Wait for three short whistles, and then heave up your anchor!"
"Understood, and all right," added the spokesman of the West Wind.
"Captain Rombold!" exclaimed Christy to himself, as he heard for the first time the name of the commander of the Tallahatchie.
The lieutenant, acting as the servant of the French detective at St. George's in the Bermudas, had seen Captain Rombold, and had heard him converse for an hour with Mr. Gilfleur, when he was in command of the Dornoch, which had been captured by the Chateaugay, on board of which Christy was a passenger. He was known to be a very able and brave officer, and his defeat was owing more to the heavier metal of the loyal ship than to any lack of skill or courage on the part of the Confederate commander. The last the young officer knew about him, he was a prisoner of war in New York, and had doubtless been exchanged for some loyal officer of equal rank, for the enemy had plenty of them on hand.
"Man the windlass, my lads," said Christy in a quiet tone, though he was still thinking of the commander of the steamer which was to tow out the schooner.
While he was waiting for the three short whistles, Graines came forward and reported in what manner he had secured the captain, and that the two men on the cotton bales were still insensible.
"You may be sure the captain will not come out of his stateroom until we let him out," added the engineer; and Christy proceeded to explain what had passed between the schooner and the steamer.
"The Tallahatchie has one of the ablest commanders that sail the ocean, for I have seen and know him," continued the lieutenant. "It is Captain Rombold, now or formerly, of the British Navy. He is a gentleman and a scholar, as well as a brave and skilful officer."
"Then Captain Breaker may have his hands full before he captures the steamer," added the engineer.
"He certainly will; but a great deal depends upon the weight of the Tallahatchie's metal."
"We shall soon have a chance to judge of that."
"I should like to know something more about this steamer, though my father's letter gives us the principal details; but we have no time now to examine her," continued Christy.
"Who's that?" demanded Graines, as he saw a man walking forward over the bales of cotton.
It proved to be Bokes, who had slept off a part of the effects of the debauch; but Sopsy had probably consumed a large portion of the contents of his bottle.
"Does you uns happen to have any more apple-jack?" asked the fellow. "Somehow I lost nigh all o' mine, and I'm sufferin', dyin' for a drink."
"French, take him to the deck-house, and fasten him in," said Christy in a low tone.
"Come with me, my hearty, and we'll see what there is in the deck-house," said the seaman, as he took the man by the arm and led him to the place indicated. "Now go in and find your bunk. Get into it, and I will look for a bottle here."
[Illustration: "Dowse that glim in your fo'castle!" Page 111.]
Bokes crept to his bunk, and stretched himself out there. French took the bottle the lieutenant had emptied into the bay, and gave it to him. Then he closed the door, and finding a padlock and hasp on it, he locked him in. Two of the three men who had remained on board of the schooner were now prisoners; and Sopsy was considered as harmless as a fishworm.
French had hardly reported what he had done before the three short whistles were sounded, and Christy gave the order to heave up the anchor.
"West Wind, ahoy!" shouted the same officer who had spoken before.
"On board the steamer!" replied French, when he was directed to reply.
"Dowse that glim on your fo'castle!" shouted the officer, as with a liberal dose of profanity he demanded if they were all fools on board of the schooner. "Put out every light on board!"
"Ay, ay, sir!" responded French, as Graines extinguished the lantern on the forecastle; and Christy directed him to do the same with the cabin lamp.
He looked at his watch before he put it out, and found it was quarter-past three. The captain of the steamer had evidently waited for a favorable moment to start on his perilous voyage, and the engineer noticed when he went forward after he had secured Captain Sullendine, that the fog was again settling down on the bay.
"On board the steamer!" shouted French, as directed. "Anchor aweigh, sir!" Then a minute later, "All clear, and the towline slack!"
From the sounds that came from the forward part of the steamer, it was evident that she had heaved up her anchor before she gave the three whistles for the schooner to do so.
"West Wind, ahoy!" called the officer from the Tallahatchie. "Stand by your helm with your best man!"
Graines had just gone aft, and had taken the wheel of the vessel; but Christy sent French to take his first trick at the helm. The tide was still setting into the bay, and it was within half an hour of the flood. The schooner was beginning to sway off from the shore as the tide struck her, when the gong bell in the engine-room of the steamer was heard. She went ahead very slowly, and straightened the towline. Christy took a careful survey of its fastenings, to assure himself that it was all right, and then mounted the cotton bales, to observe the progress of the vessel.
Of course the steamer was under the direction of a skilful pilot, doubtless the best that could be had, for the present venture was an exceedingly important one to the Confederate cause. The Tallahatchie was perhaps a better vessel than any of those which had done so much mischief among the ships of the loyal American marine, and in no manner could the Southern cause be more effectually assisted than by these cruisers.
As the vessels headed to the southward, Christy went to the binnacle, and watched the course.
CHAPTER X
THE CASTING OFF OF THE TOWLINE
Christy Passford had been through this channel at least half a dozen times in the Bellevite, and knew all the courses and bearings, though the latter did not count in the dense fog which had settled down on the vicinity of the fort. The lights in the binnacle of the West Wind had not been put out, though they could not be noticed outside of the schooner. The great fortress could not be seen, and it was as silent as a tomb.
"How does she head, Christy?" asked Graines, as they met at the wheel.
"South a quarter west," replied the lieutenant, "which is the correct course. The fog is very dense just now. I think we have passed the obstructions by this time, though I do not know precisely where they are placed."
"I should call it mighty ticklish navigation just here," added the engineer.
"It is all of that, or will be in five or ten minutes more. Sand Island Lighthouse is not more than a quarter of a mile from the middle of the channel, and at that point the course changes. Perhaps the pilot can make out the lighthouse in the fog. If he don't he will run into five or six feet of water in a few minutes, out of eight fathoms or more."
"I suppose you are prepared to let go the towline if anything goes wrong, Mr. Passford?" added the engineer, perhaps as a suggestion rather than as a question.
"I hope it will not come to that, for the schooner might get aground on the Knoll before we could make sail," replied Christy.
"The steamer has shifted her helm," said Graines, to the great relief of the lieutenant. "The fog is lifting again, and the pilot must have seen the lighthouse. We are headed more to the eastward now."
"The course is south by west, three-quarters west, when the lighthouse bears west by south. We are out of the woods now, and there will be no trouble at all till some blockader stirs up the waters," said Christy.
"I wonder where the Bellevite is just now," added Graines, as he looked all about him as the fog lifted a little more, though it was still too thick to make out any vessel, if there were any near.
"If my messenger reached the ship in time, she will be found somewhere near the channel," replied Christy. "Call Lines, if you please, Mr. Graines."
The seaman presently appeared; and the lieutenant directed him to take the wheel, French instructing him how to keep the vessel in line with the steamer.
"I believe you have sailed a schooner, French," said Christy, when he had taken the man to the quarter.
"Yes, sir; I was mate of a coaster for three years, and I should have become master of her if the war had not come, and I felt that I ought to go into the navy, though I haven't got ahead much yet, as I expected I should; but I am satisfied to fight for my country where I am."
"That is patriotic; and I hope a higher position will be found for you. But we have not time to talk about that now," continued Christy. "It may be necessary or advisable for Mr. Graines and myself to leave the West Wind at any moment now. In that case I shall place this vessel in your charge, and you will take her off where the Bellevite was moored last night, and come to anchor."
"Thank you, sir; and I will endeavor to do my duty faithfully," replied French, touching his cap.
"Now call the men aft, and I will explain the matter to them."
The lieutenant explained the situation, and directed the other five seamen to respect and obey the man he had selected as captain. Then he directed French to cast off the stops from the foresail and mainsail, and have the jib and flying-jib ready to set at a moment's notice.
"I don't think Captain Sullendine can get out of his stateroom, where he has been confined, or Bokes out of the deck-house; but if either of them should do so, you must secure them as you think best," continued Christy. "Do you fully understand your orders, French?"
"Perfectly, Mr. Passford; and I will do my duty as well as I know how," answered the able seaman, who, like many others in the service, deserved a better position.
The new officer and crew went to work on the sails, and in a few minutes they were ready to be set. Another bank of fog was rolling up, in which the two vessels would soon be involved. But the Tallahatchie was in a position where it was plain sailing now, and her future troubles would all come from the blockaders.
"There you are!" exclaimed the engineer, as the peal of a gun boomed over the water from the westward. "The steamer has been seen by a blockader, and she will catch it now."
"I don't believe that was one of the Bellevite's guns," added Christy. "Captain Breaker would not take a position over to the westward, for that would give him the outside track, and he always goes at anything by the shortest way."
"We have the fog again for the next ten or fifteen minutes. The blockader that fired that shot must have got a sight at the steamer, and she is still pegging away at her. We may get knocked over by our own guns," continued Graines.
"There is no danger at present. She can't hit anything in this fog except by a chance shot."
"And one of them sometimes does the most mischief. The fog is heavier just now than it has been at any time during the night. I can't see the Tallahatchie just now."
"It is blacker than a stack of blackbirds," added Christy. "I am confident that we are at least a mile south of the lighthouse, and we will take advantage of the gloom to hoist the mainsail, and then the foresail if it holds as it is now;" and he gave the order to French, who was assisted by the engineer in the work.
The lieutenant took the wheel, and sent Lines to assist the others. The blockader to the westward continued to discharge her guns; but her people could see nothing, and her solid shot began to fall astern of the West Wind, and the Tallahatchie took no notice of her or her guns. Christy saw that the fog was lifting again, and this would reveal to the steamer ahead what he had been doing. Besides, he had gone in tow as long as he intended. Graines reported the two sails as set.
"Stand by to hoist the jib!" he shouted, deeming it no longer necessary to conceal his movements.
"What are you doing there?" demanded the officer, who seemed to be in charge of the after part of the steamer; and his tones, with the flood of profanity he poured out, indicated that he was in a violent fit of anger.
"I reckon we won't tow any farther," replied Christy, who was still at the wheel, and the officer yelled loud enough for him to hear at the helm; but French repeated his answer.
"All ready to hoist the jib," Graines reported.
"Cast off the towline!" shouted Christy at the top of his lungs. "Hoist the jib!"
"Towline all clear!" called the engineer a moment later, and the jib went up in a hurry.
The jib filled on the starboard tack, and the West Wind went off to the south-east as Christy put up the helm. The fog lifted just enough to enable the officer at the stern of the steamer to see the West Wind as she went off on her new course. No one on the former could have suspected that the latter had changed hands; for French had answered for Captain Sullendine every time a call was made, and his voice was not unlike that of the master of the schooner.
Christy could not understand why the officer who used so many expletives should be dissatisfied, for the Tallahatchie could certainly make better time when no longer encumbered by the towing of the West Wind. But it must look to him just as though the schooner would be captured by the steamer to the westward, which had been uselessly firing at the blockade-runners in the densest of the fog. He could not help seeing that the vessel in tow had set her sails, and therefore the casting off of the wire rope could not have been caused by an accident.
The action of the captain of the schooner, for they had no reason to suppose the change on board of the schooner was not made by him, must have bewildered the officers of the Tallahatchie. But the fog was lifting, the steamer to windward was now under way, though moving very slowly, and her solid shot fell very near to the Confederate vessel.
By this time the sails of the West Wind were all drawing full, and the craft was making very good headway through the water. The fog bank had scattered, and appeared now to be in a dozen smaller masses, floating off in the direction of Mobile Point. Christy still retained the wheel, while Graines was putting everything in order forward and in the waist, after setting the sails.
"Send French aft to take the wheel, Mr. Graines," called Christy, as the engineer came aft to see the main sheet.
This man, who was the captain of the forecastle, one of the most important and best-paid of the petty officers, hastened aft to relieve the chief of the expedition, who went to work with his own hands when the exigency of the service required.
"Make the course south-west, French," said Christy, as he abandoned the wheel to the petty officer.
"South-west, sir," repeated the seaman.
"Can you make out the Bellevite, Mr. Graines?" asked he, as he met the engineer on the quarterdeck.
"I have kept a sharp lookout for her, Mr. Passford, but I have not seen her yet," replied Graines, as he looked earnestly in the direction in which the schooner was headed.
"If Captain Breaker received my message sent by Weeks, the ship must have taken a position somewhere below the entrance to the channel, and that is about four miles south of the fort, and out of the reach of any of its guns," added the lieutenant.
"There are half a dozen of those fog banks floating about near the water in that direction, and she may be there," replied Graines, as he took a spy-glass from the brackets in the companion. "Very likely she is down that way somewhere, and the Tallahatchie may run right into her."
"I don't think Captain Breaker would place his ship where anything of this kind would be likely to happen," replied Christy. "It is still as dark as Egypt ahead, and I think we shall see the Bellevite very soon."
The Confederate steamer had sensibly increased her speed, and gave no attention whatever to the schooner or the blockader to the westward of her. Captain Rombold seemed to be possessed of a supreme confidence in the speed of his steamer, and a complete assurance that he should escape unscathed from all pursuers, if any attempted to follow him. He was not aware that the Bellevite had recently had her bottom cleaned, and her engine put in thoroughly good condition, so that she could make as many knots in an hour as ever before; and that was saying more than could be said of any other craft in the navy.
"I would give my month's pay to know what the Tallahatchie has for a midship gun," said Christy, still gazing at the Confederate vessel as she continued to increase her speed.
Suddenly, without saying anything, Graines, who had been at his side, left him, and hastened to the companion, where he stooped down and gazed into the cabin. Christy had heard nothing to attract his attention, but he concluded that Captain Sullendine had escaped from his prison, and he called the two men who had been stationed in the waist to the quarter-deck to render such assistance as the engineer might need; but this officer remained at the entrance to the cabin, and made no further movement.
CHAPTER XI
A HAPPY RETURN TO THE BELLEVITE
Although he anticipated a disagreeable scene with the captain of the West Wind, who, he supposed, had slept off the fumes of the inordinate quantity of liquor he had drunk, he did not consider that there was any peril in the situation, for he had plenty of force to handle him easily. His curiosity was excited, and he walked over to the companion, where Graines appeared to be gazing into the darkness of the cabin; but he did not interfere with the proceedings of his fellow-officer.
"We don't need the men you have called from the waist," said the engineer in a low tone.
Christy sent the two men back to their former station. As he was returning to his chosen position abaft the companion, he saw a glimmer of light in the gloom of the cabin. Graines invited him to take a place at his side, chuckling perceptibly as he made room for him. The lieutenant stooped down so that he could see into the cabin, and discovered a man with a lighted match in his hand, fumbling at the door of the closet where Captain Sullendine kept his whiskey.
"Is that the captain?" whispered Christy, who could not make out the man, though he was not as tall as the master of the West Wind.
"No; it is Bokes," replied Graines. "He must have got out of the deck-house through one of the windows. He found the bottle French gave him was empty, and I have no doubt his nerves are in a very shaky condition."
Both of the officers had leaned back, so that their whispers did not disturb the operator in the cabin. His first match had gone out, and he lighted another. Captain Sullendine had been too much overcome by his potations to take his usual precautions for the safety of his spirit-room, and the observers saw that the key was in the door. Bokes took one of the bottles, and carried it to the table. His match went out, and he poked about for some time in the cabin.
Presently he was seen again, coming out of the pantry with a lighted lantern in his hand, which he placed on the table. He had a corkscrew in the other hand, with which he proceeded, as hurriedly as his trembling hands would permit, to open the bottle, for the master had drained the last one. Then he poured out a tumblerful of whiskey, as the observers judged it was from its color, and drank it off. At this point Graines descended to the cabin and confronted the fellow.
Christy, after taking a long look to the south-east, followed the engineer into the cabin, for it was possible that his companion intended to look into the condition of Captain Sullendine, and he desired to be present at the interview.
"Good-morning, Bokes," said Graines, as he placed himself in front of the seaman.
"Mornin', Mr. Balker," replied Bokes; and the heavy drink he had just taken appeared to have done nothing more than steady his nerves, for he seemed to have the full use of his faculties.
"How do you feel this morning, my friend?" continued the engineer; and Christy thought he was making himself very familiar with the boozing seaman, who was at least fifty years old.
"Fine's a fiddle-string," replied Bokes. "We done got out all right, I reckon;" and it was plain that he had not taken notice that the schooner was no longer in tow of the steamer.
"All right," replied Graines, as he placed himself on a stool, and pushed another towards the sailor, who seated himself. "By the way, friend Bokes, I suppose you have been on board of the Tallahatchie?"
"More'n a dozen times, here 'n' up in Mobile. My fust cousin's an 'iler aboard on her," replied Bokes.
"How many guns does she carry?" asked the engineer in a very quiet tone, though the man did not seem to be at all suspicious that he was in the act of being used for a purpose.
"I don't jest know how many guns she kerries; but she's got a big A'mstrong barker 'midships that'll knock any Yankee ship inter the middle o' next year 'n less time 'n it'll take you to swaller a tot o' Kaintuck whiskey. It's good for five-mile shots."
"This is her midship gun, you say?"
"Midship gun, sir; 'n I heard 'em say it flung a shot nigh on to a hundred pounds," added Bokes.
Both Christy and Graines asked the man other questions; but he had not made good use of his opportunities, and knew very little about the armament of the Tallahatchie; yet he remembered what he had heard others say about her principal gun. The lieutenant knew all about the Armstrong piece, for he had in his stateroom the volume on "Ordinance and Gunnery," by Simpson, and he had diligently studied it.
"Mr. Passford," said one of the hands at the head of the companion ladder.
"On deck," replied Christy.
"Steamer on the port bow," added the seaman.
"That must be the Bellevite," said the lieutenant.
"Now you may go on deck, Bokes," added Graines, as he drove the boozer ahead of him, and followed his superior.
He instructed the men in the waist to keep an eye on Bokes, and sent him forward. Then he took the precaution to lock the doors at the companion-way, and joined Christy on the quarterdeck.
"That's the Bellevite without a doubt," said Christy, as he directed the spy-glass he had taken from the brackets, and was still looking through it. "But she is farther to the eastward than I expected to find her."
"I suppose her commander knows what he is about," replied Graines.
"Certainly he does; and I do not criticise his action."
All the steamers on the blockade except the Bellevite and the one in the west had been sent away on other duty, for it was believed that the former would be enough to overhaul anything that was likely to come out of Mobile Bay at this stage of the war. Sure of the steamer of which he was the executive officer, Christy directed his glass towards the one on the other side of the channel. She had received no notice of the approach of a powerful blockade-runner, and she had not a full head of steam when she discovered the Tallahatchie. Besides, she was one of the slowest vessels in the service.
The black smoke was pouring out of her smokestack as though she was using something besides anthracite coal in her furnaces, and she was doing her best to intercept the Confederate. She was still firing her heaviest gun, though it could be seen that her shots fell far short of the swift steamer.
"They have seen the Bellevite on board of the Tallahatchie, and she has changed her course," said Graines, while Christy was still watching the movements of the blockader in the west. "Probably Captain Rombold knows all about the Bellevite, and he is not anxious to get too near her."
"She has pointed her head to the south-west, and the Bellevite is changing her course. I hope we shall not miss her," added Christy.
When the fog bank blew over and revealed her presence on board of the West Wind, the Bellevite was not more than half a mile to the southward, but she was at least two miles to the eastward of her.
"Can we get any more sail on this craft, Mr. Graines?" asked the lieutenant.
"We can set her two gaff-topsails."
"Do so as speedily as possible."
Christy went to the wheel, and Graines, with three men at each sail, assisting himself, soon had shaken out and set the gaff-topsails. The effect was immediately apparent in the improved sailing of the schooner. A Confederate flag was found in the signal chest, and it was set at the main topmast head, with the American ensign over it, so that it could be easily seen on board of the Bellevite. The lieutenant was now very confident that he should intercept his ship.
"Now clear away that quarter-boat, so that we can drop it into the water without any delay," continued Christy, as he gave up the wheel to Lines again.
Graines hastened to obey the order, for the Bellevite was rushing through the water at her best speed, and it was evident enough by this time that Weeks had faithfully performed the duty assigned to him.
"A small pull on the fore-sheet, Londall," called Christy to one of the men on the forecastle. "Another on the main sheet," he added to Fallon in the waist.
The bow of the West Wind was thus pointed closer into the wind; and the gaff-topsails enabled her to hold her speed after this change. Paul Vapoor, the chief engineer of the Bellevite, was plainly doing his best in the engine-room, and if the lieutenant had been a sporting man, he would have been willing to wager that his ship would overhaul the Tallahatchie; for on an emergency she had actually steamed twenty-two knots an hour, and Christy believed she could do it now, being in first-rate condition, if the occasion required.
"What time is it now, Mr. Graines?" asked Christy.
"Quarter-past four," replied the engineer, when he had lighted a match and looked at his watch.
"I thought it was later than that, and I have been looking for some signs of daylight," replied the lieutenant.
"It is just breaking a little in the east."
"I suppose Captain Sullendine is still asleep."
"No doubt of it; he has not had two hours yet in his berth, and he is good for two hours more at least."
"I think we shall be on board of the Bellevite in ten minutes more," continued Christy, as he noted the position of the ship. "Have you instructed French what to do with Captain Sullendine if he should attempt to make trouble?"
"I told him to keep him in his stateroom, and I feel pretty sure he can't get out. If Bokes, who must have an idea of what is going on by this time, is troublesome, I told French to tie his hands behind him, and make him fast to the fore-rigging."
"The fog is settling down again on the Tallahatchie; but Captain Breaker knows where she is, and he will not let up till he has got his paw on her," said Graines. "The blockader in the west isn't anywhere now. She could not do a thing with such a steamer as that Confederate."
The West Wind was now directly in the path of the Bellevite, and in five minutes more she stopped her screw. Possibly her commander was bewildered at the sight of the schooner, whose flag indicated that she was already a prize, though he could hardly understand to what vessel; for nothing was known on board of her in regard to the cotton vessel the Tallahatchie was to tow to sea.
"Stand by to lower the boat on the quarter!" shouted Christy, perhaps a little excited at the prospect of soon being on the deck of his own ship, as he and Graines took their places in the craft.
The four men at the falls lowered the boat into the water in the twinkling of an eye, and the two officers dropped the oars into the water as soon as it was afloat. They pulled like men before the mast, and went astern of the schooner, whose head had been thrown up into the wind to enable the officers to embark in safety. French was now in command of the schooner, and he filled away as soon as the boat pulled off from her side.
The Bellevite had stopped her screw a little distance from the West Wind, and, as the boat approached her, she backed her propeller. Her gangway had been lowered, and the two officers leaped upon the landing. They had hardly done so before the great gong in the engine-room was heard, and the steamer went ahead again. The boat was allowed to go adrift; but Christy shouted to French to pick it up. The lieutenant's heart beat a lively tattoo as he mounted the steps, and ascended to the deck.
CHAPTER XII
A LIVELY CHASE TO THE SOUTH-WEST
Captain Breaker had been in the main rigging with his night-glass, watching the movements of the chase; but he recognized the voice of Christy when he shouted to French to pick up the quarter-boat of the schooner, as he could no longer make out the Tallahatchie in the fog.
"Good-morning, Mr. Passford," said he, as he met Christy when he descended from the rail. "I am glad to see you again."
"Good-morning, Captain Breaker," replied the lieutenant, as he took the offered hand of the commander. "I hope all is well on board, sir."
"Entirely well, and your messenger came on board in good time, so that we were in position to get the first sight of the Trafalgar when she showed herself off Sand Island Lighthouse," replied the captain, as he led the way to his cabin. "Mr. Ballard, keep a sharp lookout for the chase," he added to the acting executive officer.
"Will you allow me to put on my uniform, Captain?" asked Christy. "I don't feel quite at home on board the ship in the rigout I have worn all night."
"Certainly; for I do not wish you to show yourself to the ship's company while you look so little like a naval officer," replied the captain, as he went to take another look at the darkness ahead.
The lieutenant hastened to his stateroom, and in a very short time he had washed off the smut from his face and hands, and dressed himself in his uniform, so that he looked like quite another person, Graines had gone to his room in the steerage for the same purpose, for neither of them desired to show himself as he had appeared before Captain Sullendine.
Christy hurried to the deck as soon as he had made the change, and met the commander on the quarter-deck. Lookouts were stationed aloft and on the top-gallant forecastle, and all hands were in a state of healthy excitement in view of the stirring event which was likely to transpire before the lapse of many hours; and doubtless some of the men were moved by the prospect of prize-money, not only from the proceeds of the sale of the steamer they were chasing, but from the full freight of cotton on board of the schooner, the deck load of which had been noted by some of the crew.
The schooner which had come so close aboard of the Bellevite was a mystery to all, from the captain down to the humblest seaman; but the American ensign over the Confederate flag had been observed by a few, and this settled her status. Not more than half of the seamen were aware that an expedition had left the ship at ten o'clock the evening before, and they had had no opportunity to notice the absence of the executive officer during the night; and even yet all hands had not been called, for the regular watch was enough to get the ship under way.
The commander conducted the executive officer to his own cabin, again reminding Mr. Ballard to keep a sharp lookout for the chase. Christy felt like himself again in his neat uniform, and his vigorous and well knit, as well as graceful form, did more to show off the dress than the dress did to adorn his person.
"I am very glad to see you again, Christy," said Captain Breaker, seating himself and pointing to an arm-chair for the lieutenant, while he came down from the stately dignity of the commander of a man-of-war to the familiarity with which he treated his chief officer when they were alone. "I had no doubt that you would give a good account of yourself, as you always do. You were going on the enemy's territory, and you were in peril all the time. Now you come off in a schooner, which appears to be loaded with cotton, and how or where you picked her up is a mystery to me;" and the commander indulged in a laugh at the oddity of the young officer's reappearance. "Your messenger reported that the Trafalgar would sail at three o'clock in the morning, and I judge that she left at about that hour."
"Within ten minutes of it, and probably made an arrangement with the commandant of the fort to that effect," added Christy. "But they do not call her the Trafalgar now; though Weeks was not aware of the fact when I sent him on board. She is now the Tallahatchie, though I noticed that some in the vicinity of the fort still called her by her old name."
"Never mind the name; she will answer our purpose as well under one appellation as another. When I asked your messenger about you and the other six men of your party, he was unable to give me any information in regard to your movements; and he could not tell me how you had ascertained the hour at which the steamer was to sail," continued the captain.
"Graines and myself separated from the party as soon as we landed on the point; and we had obtained our information before we joined them again on the shore of Mobile Bay, sir. At the same time we had learned all about the West Wind"--
"The what?" interposed the commander.
"I mean the schooner West Wind, the one from which we came on board of the Bellevite, which was to be towed out by the Tallahatchie, and which was towed out by her till we on board of her cast off the towline."
"Perhaps you had better narrate the events of your expedition _seriatim_, for all you say in this disconnected manner only thickens the mystery," said the commander: and he knew that his officer had an excellent command of the English language, and could make a verbal report in a very attractive and telling style, though perhaps his fatherly interest in the young man had something to do with the matter.
Christy began his narrative with the departure from the ship, passing lightly over the minor details till he came to the meeting with the deserters from the West Wind, bivouacking in the hollow. He described the drinking bout which followed, in which he and Graines had pretended to join, stating the information he had obtained from them. He rehearsed a portion of Captain Sullendine's speech, adding that most of his auditors were the seamen from the Bellevite, though he had sent four of them back to the ship before he reached the shore.
He detailed his interview with the master of the West Wind, explaining how he had shipped the new crew with him. The scenes in the cabin were described in full; in fact, every incident of any importance which had transpired during the night was related. The commander was deeply interested, and listened without comment to the narrative up to the moment when the narrator had come on board of the Bellevite. He was not sparing in his praise of the engineer, and separated what he had said and done as far as he could from his own words and actions.
The commander then questioned him in regard to the armament of the Tallahatchie, and he repeated the meagre information he had obtained from Bokes. Some conversation concerning Armstrong guns followed; but both of them were well posted in regard to this long-range piece. Christy read the satisfaction with which the captain heard his statements on his face.
A knock at the door of the cabin disturbed the conference, and the lieutenant was directed to open the door. The shaking and straining of the ship had for some time indicated that Paul Vapoor was fully alive to the importance of getting the Bellevite's best speed out of her on the present occasion; and he did not intrust the duty to his subordinates. Christy opened the cabin door, and Midshipman Walters asked for the commander, and was admitted.
"Mr. Ballard directs me to inform you, sir, that we are gaining on the chase," said the young officer. "The fog has lifted again, and we can make her out very clearly. The Holyoke has abandoned the chase, and appears to be headed for the schooner that came to on the starboard of the ship."
"Tell Mr. Ballard to keep the ship as she is, headed for the Tallahatchie," replied Captain Breaker.
"The Tallahatchie, sir?" queried the midshipman.
"Formerly the Trafalgar," added the commander.
The young officer touched his cap and retired.
"This Captain Sullendine is still secured in his stateroom on board of the West Wind, is he?" asked the captain, rising from his arm-chair.
"He was when I left the schooner, sir," replied Christy. "French, the captain of the forecastle, is in charge of the vessel, with orders to anchor her a couple of miles to the eastward of the lighthouse. I have already commended French to your attention, Captain, as a faithful and reliable man, and I think he deserves promotion."
"Your recommendation will go a great way to procure it for him," added the commander with a significant smile.
"He is a thorough seaman, has been the mate of a large coaster, and would have become master of her if his patriotic duty had not led him to ship in the navy."
"He is a resolute and brave fellow in action, as I have had occasion to observe, and I shall remember him. When you are writing to your father it would be well for you to mention him; and the thing will be done at your request if not at mine."
"It certainly would not be done without your indorsement, for my father will not indulge in any favoritism aside from real merit," protested the lieutenant, with some warmth.
"You are quite right, Christy. We must go on deck now," added Captain Breaker, as he moved towards the door. "You have been up all night, my boy; it will be some hours before we come within reach of the chase, and you can turn in and get a little sleep before anything stirring takes place on board."
The excitement which had animated the young officer during the night had subsided with the rendering of his report, and the responsibility of a command no longer rested upon him, and for the first time since he embarked in the whaleboat, he began to feel tired and sleepy. He went on deck with the commander, and took a survey, first of the chase, then of the Holyoke, and finally of the West Wind.
Captain Breaker thought the Tallahatchie was about five miles distant. Seen through the glass, for the fog had all blown away, and the daylight had begun to obscure the stars, the steamer seemed to be doing her best. The Holyoke was headed to the eastward, evidently intending to chase the West Wind, for she could not yet make out her flags, indicating that she was already a prize. She need not have troubled herself to pursue the schooner if she had known the facts in regard to her, for she was entitled to a share of the prize as a member of the blockading fleet at the time of her capture. But she could prevent her from being retaken by any boat expedition sent from the shore, as her lonely position where the Bellevite had been for several days might tempt some enterprising Confederate officer to do.
Although the last heaving of the log showed twenty knots, it was a quiet time of the deck of the Bellevite, and all the excitement on board was confined to the engine and fire rooms. With sundry gapes Christy had taken in the situation, and then he concluded to avail himself of the commander's permission to retire to his stateroom, where he was soon in a sound slumber.
Just before, Captain Breaker had retired to his cabin, where he had a chart of the Gulf of Mexico spread out on his table. Assuming the point where the Tallahatchie had changed her course to the south-west, he drew a line in that direction, and realized that the chase could not go clear of the Passes of the Mississippi River; and she was likely to sight some Federal steamer in that locality.
As the daylight increased the weather improved so far as the fog was concerned and it promised to be a clear day, for the stars had not been obscured at any time during the night. The only alternative the commander could see for the chase, as he studied the chart, was to go to the southward before he could sight the Pass à l'Outre. He was so confident that this must be his course, that he decided to take advantage of the situation, and he went on deck at once, where he ordered the officer of the deck to make the course south south-west.
CHAPTER XIII
THE FIRST SHOT OF BLUMENHOFF
Captain Breaker watched the Tallahatchie with the most earnest attention; and it was not five minutes after he had given out the new course before she changed her direction, though not to the south, but enough to carry her clear of the Passes of the Mississippi. Paul Vapoor was still crowding the engine to the utmost that could be done with safety, and he spent no little of his time in the fire room, personally directing the men in the work of feeding the furnaces.
It was evident to the commander that his ship was gaining on the Tallahatchie, at least a knot an hour, as he estimated it, and the chase could not now be more than four miles distant. This was within the range of her Armstrong gun, if it was of the calibre reported by Bokes, whose information was mere hearsay, and was open to many doubts.
"She is changing her course again, Captain Breaker," said Mr. Ballard, who had been observing the chase with the best glass on board.
"Probably she has discovered a man-of-war in the distance," added the captain.
"I cannot make out anything to the westward of her," said Mr. Ballard, who had directed his glass that way.
"She knows very well that she is liable to encounter a Federal ship on the course she is running. How does she head now?"
"As nearly south as I can make it out."
"Then we have made something on her by going to the south south-west in good season; and I am sorry I did not do it sooner," replied the commander, as he went into a fine calculation, estimating sundry angles, and figuring on the gain he was confident he had already made.
"I think she is headed due south now, Captain," said Mr. Ballard.
"So I should say, and we are headed a little too much to the westward. Make the course south by west half west, Mr. Ballard."
This course was given to the quartermaster conning the wheel. For another hour the two steamers kept on the course taken, at the end of which time the captain believed they were within three miles of each other; and the appearance, as viewed by skilful and experienced officers, verified his estimate of the relative speed of both--that the Bellevite was gaining about a knot an hour on the chase.
They had hardly agreed upon the situation before a cloud of smoke was seen to rise from the waist of the Tallahatchie, followed by the report of a heavy gun. The projectile struck the water at least a quarter of a mile ahead of the Bellevite, at which the watch on deck gave a half-suppressed cheer.
"They must have better gunners than that indicates on board of that steamer, for she has been fitted out as a cruiser," said the commander with a quiet smile.
Twenty minutes later another puff of smoke, followed by a second report, excited the attention of an officer on the deck of the loyal ship. The shot struck the water only a little less ahead of the ship than the former, and the crew gave a more vigorous cheer: but it was observed that it hit the sea a little on the starboard bow, so that if it had been better aimed it would not have reached the ship.
"She is wasting her ammunition," said the captain. "She seems to be jesting, or else she is trying to frighten us."
"I think it is some thing worse than that, Captain Breaker," replied Mr. Ballard.
"What could be worse?"
"I am inclined to the opinion that she cannot swing the gun around so as to make it bear on an object so far astern of her as this ship is at the present moment." said the lieutenant.
"He has an all sufficient remedy for that," added the captain. "He can swing his ship's head around so his gun will bear on us."
"But that would cause him to lose a quarter of a mile or more of his advantage; and she seems to be more inclined to run away from the Bellevite than to fight her," suggested the lieutenant.
"Call all hands, Mr. Ballard," said the commander; and in a few minutes all the officers and seamen were at their stations.
The call awoke Christy from his slumber, which the report of the gun and the cheering of the men had failed to do. But he understood the summons, and thought the action was about to begin. He adjusted his dress and hastened to the quarter deck, where he reported in due form to the captain. Mr. Ballard was relieved of his duties as acting executive officer, and went to his proper station to take command of his division. Christy took a careful survey of the situation, and saw that the Bellevite had gained at least two knots on the chase. The Holyoke and the West Wind were no longer in sight, though the fog seemed to be still hanging about the entrance to Mobile Bay.
"The Tallahatchie has fired two shots at us, Mr. Passford; but she wasted her ammunition," said the commander. "I am inclined to agree with Mr. Ballard that she cannot swing her Armstrong gun so as to cover the Bellevite."
"She has stopped her screw, sir!" exclaimed the first lieutenant, who was looking at the chase through the best glass.
"Make the course west, Mr. Passford!" said the captain with energy.
"Quartermaster, make it west!" shouted Christy.
"West, sir!" repeated the quartermaster, as he caused the helmsmen to heave over the wheel.
Directing his glass to the chase again, Christy saw the Tallahatchie swing around so that she was broadside to the Bellevite. Almost at the same moment the smoke rose from her deck, and the sound of the gun reached the ears of the officers and crew. The shot passed with a mighty whiz between the fore and main mast of the ship, cutting away one of the fore topsail braces, but doing no other damage. The seamen cheered as they had before. The Tallahatchie started her screw as soon as she had discharged her gun, and resumed her former course, the Bellevite doing the same.
If the loyal ship had not promptly altered her course, the projectile would have raked her, and must have inflicted much greater injury in the spars and rigging. But both vessels promptly resumed their former relative positions, though the Tallahatchie had lost some of her advantage by coming to, while her pursuer had only made a small circuit without stopping her engine for a moment.
"If she does that again, Mr. Passford, we must be ready to return her fire," said the captain. "Have the pivot gun ready, and aim for her Armstrong, which seems to be sufficiently prominent on her deck to make a good target."
Christy hastened forward, and gave the order to Mr. Ballard, in whose division the great Parrot was included. The signal was promptly given for manning the gun, and seventeen men immediately sprang to their stations. The men were armed with cutlasses, muskets, battle-axes, pistols, and pikes, which were so disposed as to be in readiness for boarding the enemy, or repelling boarders.
"A solid shot, and aim at the pivot gun of the enemy," said Christy in a low tone to the second lieutenant, who had the reputation of being an expert in the handling of guns of the largest calibre.
There were two captains to the pivot gun, one on each side, stationed nearest to the base of the breech. Seventeen men were required to work the pivot gun, whose duties were defined in the names applied to them, the powderman being the odd one. The first and second captains were numbers one and two; the odd numbers being on the right, and the even on the left of the piece: number three was the first loader, four the first sponger, five the second loader, six the second sponger, seven the first shellman, eight the second shellman, nine the first handspikeman, ten the second handspikeman, eleven the first train tackleman, twelve the second train tackleman (the last two at the breech, next to the captains), thirteen first side tackleman, fourteen second side tackleman, fifteen first port tackleman, sixteen second port tackleman.
The gun crew had been frequently drilled in the management of the piece, and the men were entirely at home in their stations. Other hands had been trained in serving the gun, so that the places of any disabled in action could be replaced. The service at the Parrot was not all that was required of the men forming the gun crew, for each was also a first or second boarder, a pumpman, or something else, and to each number one or two weapons were assigned, as musket and pike, sword and pistol, battle-axe. When the order to board the enemy was given, every man knew his station and his proper officer.
"Silence, men!" commanded the second lieutenant, "Cast loose and provide!"
These orders were repeated by the first captain of the gun. It is his duty to see the piece cleared and cast loose, and everything made ready for action. He and the second captain "provide" themselves with waist belts and primers, and the first with some other implements. But the handling of one of these great guns is about as technical as a surgical operation would be, and it would be quite impossible for the uninitiated to understand it, though it is every-day work to the ordinary man-of-war's-man.
Prompted by the executive officer, who had been further instructed by the captain, all the series of steps had been taken which put the piece in readiness to be discharged, and all that remained to be done was to adjust the aim, which is done by the first captain. At this time the distance between the two ships had been considerably reduced. The captain and the first lieutenant were closely watching the chase with glasses.
The crew of the Tallahatchie could be seen at work at the long gun, and another shot from it was momentarily expected. The instant the bow of the enemy began to swerve to port, the captain of the Bellevite gave the order to put the helm to starboard. Almost at the same instant the enemy stopped her screw, swung round and fired her long gun. The projectile crashed through the bulwarks between the foremast and top-gallant forecastle, wounding two men with the splinters which flew in every direction.
Dr. Linscott and his mates had established themselves in the cockpit, to which the wounded are conveyed, in action, for treatment. The two men who had been injured by the splinters were not disabled, and they were ordered to report to the surgeon. Before the enemy could resume her course, the captain of the pivot gun had caught his aim, and discharged the Parrot. All hands watched for the result of the shot, and the glasses of the captain and the first lieutenant were directed to the chase.
She was near enough now to be observed with the naked eye with tolerable accuracy, and a shout went up from the men at the pivot gun, in which the rest of the crew on deck joined, as they saw that the shot had struck the midship gun of the enemy, or very near it; and this was the point where old Blumenhoff, the captain of the gun, had been directed to aim. He was a German, but he had served for twenty-one years in the British navy, and had won a brilliant reputation in his present position.
It could not be immediately determined whether or not the Armstrong had been disabled. The Tallahatchie had swung round again and resumed her flight; but her commander must have realized by this time that he was getting the worst of it. Paul Vapoor had not left his post in the engine and fire room, to ascertain how the battle was going, but still plied all his energies in driving the Bellevite to the utmost speed she could possibly attain. The log was frequently heaved, and the last result had been sent down to him by Midshipman Walters, and it was twenty-one knots.
During the next hour the long gun of the enemy was not again discharged, and the officers of the loyal ship were assured that it had been rendered useless by Blumenhoff's only shot.
CHAPTER XIV
THE PROGRESS OF THE ACTION
The tremendous speed of the Bellevite had been telling with prodigious effect upon the distance between the two steamers, which was now reduced to not more than a mile and a half. Captain Rombold could not help realizing by this time that the American-built vessel outsailed the English-built. If the Trafalgar was good for twenty knots an hour, as represented, she had hardly attained that speed, as Captain Breaker judged by comparison with that of his own ship.
The Armstrong gun was still silent and it was pretty well settled that it had been disabled. In this connection Christy recalled something he had read in Simpson about the "inability of the Armstrong gun to resist impact," and he sent Midshipman Walters to bring the volume from his state-room. When it came he found the place, and read that three shots had been fired into one of them from a nine-pounder, either of which would have been fatal to the piece; and the section described the effect of each upon it.
He showed the book open at the place to Captain Breaker; but he had read it, and carried the whole matter in his mind. The gun quoted was weak, though the one on the deck of the Tallahatchie was vastly larger; but a correspondingly heavy force had been brought to bear upon it.
"I am satisfied that the enemy's long gun has been disabled; and while she continues the attempt to run away from us, she is unable to use her broadside guns to advantage, for she cannot bring them to bear upon us without coming to," said the commander. "But we are gaining at least a knot and a half an hour on her, and she must soon change her tactics."
"That is evident enough, sir," added Christy.
"The captain of that ship is a brave fellow, and I am confident he will fight as long as there is anything left of him," continued the captain as he occasionally directed his glass at the chase.
"He certainly will, sir, for I have seen his ship knocked out from under him, when he had abundant excuse for hauling down his flag before he did so; and we had hardly time on board of the Chateaugay to save his people before his vessel went to the bottom," continued Christy. "More than that, he is a gentleman and a scholar."
"You have told me about him, Christy; and I believe you suggested to Captain Chantor his best plan of action."
"I simply indicated what I should do in his place, and he adopted the method I mentioned," added Christy modestly.
"We may find it advisable to resort to the same plan, though I must add that it is by no means original with you. It was adopted in the war of 1812 with England."
"I did not claim the method as original, and knew very well that it was not so," replied the lieutenant.
"The conditions on both sides must be favorable to the method or it cannot be adopted. One of the ships must have heavier metal than the other, so that she can knock her enemy to pieces at her leisure, and at the same time greater speed, so that she can keep out of the reach of guns of shorter range."
"I am sorry I could not obtain more definite information in regard to the broadside guns of the Tallahatchie," added Christy. "Bokes was a stupid fellow, drunk whenever he could obtain liquor, and could remember very little of what he heard on board of the steamer. But you have the long range Parrot, and I have no doubt you can knock her to pieces in your own time, since it has been demonstrated that we can outsail her."
But at this moment the conversation was disturbed by the movement of the chase, which appeared to be again preparing to come about. The commander ordered the helm to be put to starboard to avoid being raked, and directed that the pivot gun should be discharged at the enemy. The enemy fired a broadside of three guns in quick succession, the solid shots from all them striking the Bellevite between wind and water. The carpenter's gang was hurried below to plug the shot holes.
Blumenhoff secured his aim and fired; but this time he was less happy than on the former occasion, and though the shot went between the masts, no great damage appeared to be done. The enemy started her screw immediately, and swung around so as to present her starboard broadside before the Parrot could be made ready for another shot. The Tallahatchie delivered another three shots, two of which went wide of the mark. The third struck the carriage of the pivot gun, but fortunately it was not disabled, for it had been built to resist a heavier ball than the one which had struck it.
The captain of the Bellevite gave the order to Christy to swing to the ship, and give the enemy a broadside. The order was promptly executed as the enemy came about and resumed her course to the southward, which was certainly a very bad movement on her part. The four guns on the port side, two sixties and two thirties, sent their solid shots over the stern of the Tallahatchie.
A moment later, as the fresh breeze carried away the smoke to the north-east, the crew set up a lively cheer, for the mizzen mast of the chase toppled over into the water, and the pilot house seemed to have been knocked into splinters.
"Well done!" exclaimed Captain Breaker, clapping his hands as he faced the guns' crews on the port side, and Christy joined him in the demonstration.
The men of the division gave another lusty cheer in response to the approval of the two chief officers. The captain had already ordered the ship to be put about so as to deliver the starboard broadside, and the other division of guns were impatient to have their chance at the enemy.
Christy had clapped his hands with his spy-glass under his arm; and when he had rendered his tribute of applause, he directed the instrument to the enemy. A squad of men were at work over the ruins of the pilot house, which was still forward, as the vessel had been built for a pleasure yacht, and another gang were getting the extra wheel at the stern ready for use.
The Bellevite came about in obedience to the order Christy had given to the quartermaster conning the wheel, and the guns on the starboard side were all ready to deliver their messengers of death and destruction.
"Aim at that extra wheel," said the captain; and Christy delivered the order to the officers of the division.
The broadside was of the same metal as on the port side, and the result was looked for with even more interest than before. The appearance was that all three shots had struck at or near the wheel at the stern, and Christy promptly directed his glass to that part of the steamer, the captain doing the same thing.
"There is nothing of the wheel left in sight," said the lieutenant. "The taffrail is knocked away, and at least one of those shots must have knocked the captain's cabin into utter confusion."
"Go ahead at full speed, Mr. Passford," said Captain Breaker, after he had fully measured with his eye the damage done to the enemy.
"Her steering gear seems to be entirely disabled, sir," continued Christy, after he had given the order to the chief engineer. "She does not appear to be able to come about, as no doubt she would if she could, so as to bring her broadside guns to bear upon us."
The order had been given before to load the broadside and pivot guns with shells. The enemy had not started her screw for the reason that the ship was unmanageable with her steering gear disabled. The action had certainly gone against her; but she gave no indication that she was ready to surrender for the Confederate flag, which had been hoisted at the mainmast head when the mizzen was shot away, still floated in the breeze.
A gang of men were still at work where the extra wheel had been, and the commander evidently expected he should be able to repair the damage in some manner so that he could steer his ship. Captain Breaker gave the command to stop the screw, and a mighty hissing and roaring of steam followed when Christy transmitted it to the engine room. The order to come about on the headway that remained succeeded, and the three shells immediately exploded on the deck or in the hull of the enemy; but the extent of the damage could not be estimated.
- Got it, sir
One thousand
Give the money to the secretary
Lesson Three. 
Don't give money to your seniors. 
Take from them
What...?
- This I shall explain later
Human beings were divided in two at the beginning of creation
Do you know?
- Yes, man and woman
One is down beside the lake, one under that tree, for the third... you will have to climb the hillock. 
Go
Man and woman? 
No, I was talking of another divide
This dichotomy is of great significance
It is the divide between winners and losers... between the ones above and the ones down under
If you don't belong up there, you belong down there
In the game that is life, there are no draws
You either win, or you lose.
And the winner... is right on top. 
And the ones on top, aren't the ones down under
Got it?
- Yes
You haven't got a thing! 
Even I didn't understand what I was saying
Tell me the truth. 
Do you, or don't you understand?
Lesson five. 
If you don't understand something, say it. 
Understand? 
Eat
Oh why...?
Why is this happening to me?
Why does the heart miss someone so suddenly?
These little takes, oh why?
Those awkward moments of meeting a stranger... are gone. 
Today, in many hues he torments my heart
Oh why, that awkwardness in moments when I met yesterday's stranger?
Oh why, today these shades of blue torment my heart?
Oh, such strange moments
Before I have dreamt my dream...
The palace I dreamt of has shattered
Oh why...
Oh why is this happening to my life?
Why does the heart miss someone so suddenly?
These little takes, oh why?
I stand on the same road...
I am taking the same journey
But I haven't with me, my fellow traveller
My eyes seek everywhere on the same road; the journey is the same
But my fellow-traveller is not with me
My eyes seek... upon the same road
Oh where are gone, those evenings of ecstasy?
Oh where are gone, my days when he was mine?
Oh why...
Oh why is this happening to my life?
Why does the heart miss someone so suddenly?
These little takes, oh why?
Time was when, like you, I too was in love
Look at this. 
I loved her so much, I never imagined she wouldn't be mine
But I didn't get her.
- Why?
My foolishness. 
Anyway, forget those old tales
Your training is over.
Tomorrow, you leave
Don't be foolish enough to lose in love, like I did
This I expect from a young man like you. 
Remember one thing
In love, nothing is unfair
And Arun, I have begun to take a special liking for you
You know why?
- No
Were you dumb, like me?
Not that. 
Today I have the money, the mansions, the respectability... and yet I have nothing. 
Guess why?
- Why?
Because I don't have my Prabha
Yes Arun. 
She's the one, whom I miss.
And I have everything, yet nothing
Her name was Prabha too.
Well, so I didn't get Prabha
But I have always tried to bring man and woman together
I'm travelling with you to Bombay on business. 
And I'll also see... how you capitalise on my training
Where have you been?
- Away on work
You didn't even inform me.
- So Nagesh, what's happening?
Prabha and I won the doubles.
- Really?
Prabha, I'll wait for you ahead
Go on
Looks like Arun is back.
- Yes
Will you say something?
- Today Nagesh...
Finish laughing. 
We'll talk afterwards.
- Listen!
Holiday over?
Stand up and wish me
Say it
What happened?
What is the matter?
Why are you screaming
Give me the Bluebird statements.
- Not ready yet
What have you been doing?
It's all wrong
I'll be back
Add it up
But I checked it.
- Then how did this happen?
I'll correct it, and I'll bring it back
Forget it. 
I'll do it.
Get me the register
In whatever condition it is, I want to check it
Won't you check it?
- Get the statements first
The statements aren't ready yet.
In a day or two...
I want all the statements ready tomorrow. 
Work overtime if need be
I'll do it.
- I'll do it, sir
Sahib, someone is here to see you
Keep this money. 
Enjoy yourself.
And don't you ever get smart with me
Never!
Send the gentleman in.
- Yes sir
All this has to be typed today.
Why aren't these statements ready yet?
You're going to work tonight till it's over, get it? 
Go
I won't move your leave application until the Bluebird job is done
And you... why are you staring at me?
Get me a cup of tea
Have you sent someone to the garage?
- My room-mate is going there tomorrow
I hear there's an old motorcycle for sale. 
Can you show me?
Sold.
- Sold? 
1925 make...?
British-made? 
Royal Enfield?
- Yes, I sold it
For how much?
- 3,000
Who was he?
- Some crazy fellow. 
Get to work
Who's Arun?
Fine
What?
Prabha is coming too?
No, I'll bring her along
No, I'll come on my own
Who is this?
Let me see
Arun on the line.
- Give me
Fixed?
Who's Samovar?
I'll be there
Please take a seat.
- It's all right
Look, inside her womb, this woman has an elephant, a bird inside
This is Prabha. 
She works for Frank and Lloyd
This is Colonel Singh.
- And I work nowhere
How is your work going on?
- Fine
And how is your work going on?
- Which work?
Apart from work at home, and work at office, could there be any other work?
Prabha, let me reserve a table.
Please keep each other company
Get back soon
Yes?
- Lovely name
How long have you known Arun?
- Just a while
How do you find him? 
I like him.
- He's nice
I wanted to know whether you like him or not
Let's go to the restaurant.
We'll find a place
Which means that you don't like him?
- No, that's not the case
You like him, and you don't like him?
Is it that tough a question
Shall I tell you something?
Your name reminds me of another Prabha
She was in love with a boy.
But they never got together in life
Why couldn't they get together?
- They should've got together, no?
Yes, if their love was true.
- That's what I wanted to hear from you
Here comes Arun. 
Got the table?
- Yes. 
Let's go
Do you need me?
- What?
I want to take a look at the paintings. 
You go on
Come
Prabha, where have you been?
I wanted to bring you along
Arun, you ask me to get Prabha along, and here you are, with her
Prabha wanted to do some shopping.
I thought I'd give her company
Shopping for what?
- What women shop for... can't always be made public
What are we eating? 
Nagesh, why don't you lunch with us?
Is Peter in the kitchen? 
Tell him this is Mr Nagesh's order. 
What?
Peter has quit.
- What? 
Well, whoever it is... ask him to make it well.
3 chicken Alapurz, and...
We don't make French dishes anymore.
- What...?
Let's try Chinese today.
- Yes, let's go
Peter has quit?
No more Chicken Alapurz?
How was that?
- A la grande
Now we're going for Chinese.
- Where?
Flora.
- Wait! 
Forgot D'souza? 
He lied for you
Five for you.
And give Peter five
Would you like something?
- Of course. 
Chicken Alapurz
One chicken Alapurz, and ask Peter to do it well
Today!
The flowers are blossoming
My dreams are hues of gold
Every morning dawns golden
Every evening is a splash of red
Your fragrance touches the breeze, touches you... makes me ecstatic
My heart flies... to a meeting in the skies
Open your heart to the colours in your priceless dreams
At chess, Nagesh is unbeatable.
- Why is Arun taking on Nagesh?
That's a great move. 
You win.
- Play on. 
This is just my 3rd move
And I haven't checkmated you yet.
- What use playing?
I can see it clearly. 
At move 7, you will take my knight
Move 8, I take your pawn.
In moves 13 and 14, I lose my bishops
Yes, I can take that knight of yours.
In move 17... no, on move 19... you check me. 
Move 20, mate.
In the 1970 internationals...
Grand Master Klotozov played exactly this game
Yes?
You have a 1925 Royal Enfield for sale?
- Sold
When?
- A month and a half ago
How much did you sell it for?
- 3,000
Why?
- I'm willing to pay 6,000 for it
You need it?
- Can you find the man you sold it to?
Yes
Keep 500. 
Advance. 
Find out, and get back to me at this address
The paint-chrome job is over.
But it will run for a mile at most
All I want is half a mile out of it.
Here you are
Luck is when the fish walks into the net! 
Get lost
I was passing by. 
I thought I'd drop by to congratulate you. 
You deserve it too
Congratulations? 
What for?
- It won the Pune Cantonment races
It won?
- Didn't you read it in The Times?
When you sold it, you didn't say it runs only on 93 octane... and for every five litres of gas, it burns up a litre of lube
Only after I went through the manual, I found out... that a jet was missing from the carburettor. 
At last...
I found one at Pune. 
Imported parts aren't available everywhere
Sorry if you have been inconvenienced unnecessarily. 
We'll buy it back
In Pune, Colonel Singh was persistent.
He asked me where I found it
What name did you say?
- Julius Nagendra Nath Wilfred Singh
Sit, please be seated.
Abdul, get a cold drink
Have you sold it to the Colonel?
- Why should I?
The world over, there are only six of these left
A company in London is looking for this model for an exhibition
They don't even have one.
So they advertised... in all the papers all over the world.
You must've read it
Sahib, I'm an illiterate.
I sold it because I needed the cash
How would I know? 
I never even took a look at it in three years...
What was that about 3 years?
- Forget it sahib
Give the bike back to me.
- You expect me to do that?
I didn't give it to the Colonel.
- You are rich! 
By God's grace... you can buy a new one!
It's my companion of 25 years
Please give it back to me.
- But...
Let him have it sahib. 
You are a gentleman. 
He was very foolish
I have spent some 800 bucks on it.
- I'll give you 4,000 for it
Cash?
- Yes, right now
He's a moron. 
All brawn, no brains.
He's going to be grateful for this
Here's 4,000, sahib
On one condition.
- Sure
You will let me ride this bike whenever a race comes up
A hundred times, yes! 
Consider this yours. 
Please take the money
Won't you count it?
- Not necessary
Shall I call a taxi? 
Abdul...
- Not necessary. 
I'll walk
What brings you here?
- Nothing in particular
Don't you touch that.
It isn't for sale
Are you out of your mind?
Will I ever buy this?
What are you looking for?
- Nothing in particular
See you
Here's the 500, you paid at the garage
I could say you're very near to success.
I'm going to Baroda for a couple of days
Another Arun in a fix?
- You could say that
I'm not needed here, am I?
- Take your time
Just a matter of a couple of days.
- Just a couple of days
Let me call a cab for you
One must walk. 
Brisk walk is best for health. 
Get it?
Walking is best
Colonel Julius... etc Singh?
From Khandala?
Julius Nagendra Nath Wilfred Singh.
- Yes, are you?
Right.
- So you are coaching him?
Coaching him, yes.
But not in letters
Are you the one who's leading him from the drawing room to the bedroom?
In 3 simple moves.
- Written by David Abraham?
An old friend. 
What's your problem?
- This is going to be your problem
Really?
- Yes
What's this?
Come Prabha, sit. 
Sorry to call you during the lunch break. 
It's urgent
What's the matter?
- The matter is quite serious
You must stop seeing Arun.
- Why?
He's trying to seduce you.
- What are you saying?
He has learnt all the tricks.
I suspected this when he took us... to the Chinese restaurant. 
Being in love with you is just a sham
The intention is quite something else.
- What else could be the intention?
You don't know why a man chases a woman?
No seeing him from now on.
- But he has called me this evening
Where to?
- To his house
He doesn't have a house.
- He has one, in Bandra
He's going to use the classic ploy
From drawing room to bedroom in three moves
Have you read David Abraham?
- What moves?
There will be no one at home.
Romantic music will be playing
He will treat you to condiments laced with sedatives
Arun will be smoking.
An ignited matchstick... will fall on your dress.
You're going to get out of the dress
At which point of time, someone knocks on the door, and you enter his bedroom
The bedroom will have only one bed.
He walks in... he makes you sit on the bed' lights out, and...
Shut up Nagesh. 
Arun isn't so lowly.
- How am I bothered?
Go on, fall into the trap.
- Of course I'm going
Only to see whether you're saying the truth
Are you out of your mind? 
I too have a responsibility towards you
No, I'm not going to let you go.
- No Nagesh. 
I will go
Let me see how much he loves me.
But if this is true...
No need to go. 
Come, let's watch a movie together
Business in Baroda done?
- Done
Tomorrow, we're leaving.
Business here is over too
I have to meet Arun once.
- Arun had telephoned
He has invited Ms Prabha. 
Tonight.
- Tonight?
Yes.
- Where?
He has hired a place in Bandra.
- What's his hurry?
I must go!
Do you know where in Bandra?
- I don't quite know
But he gave an address.
- Let me have it
Any problem, sir?
- He's being foolish
Prabha is a nice girl. 
She loves him, I'm sure. 
He needn't use ploys
Should I accompany you, sir?
- No, you stay here
If Arun calls, tell him to do nothing until I have arrived
Staying here this evening?
What is the matter, Prabha?
- What if Arun does something like...?
What has Arun done?
Let's go
Don't be morose. 
Come to my place.
My sister has just arrived from Delhi
No, not tonight. 
I must see Arun.
Maybe for the last time
Won't you tell me?
- Not now. 
Let me see what he does
No problem finding the house?
- No
How is the place?
- Nice
Have a paan. 
It's made with Benares condiments
No, I don't feel like it
Sit Prabha. 
Why are you standing?
You live here alone?
You know very well, I'm not married.
- I mean, no one else lives here?
As of now, no one
That act of being in love is a sham, intent being something quite different
What is the matter? 
Why are you so silent? 
Do have a paan
I'm not silent. 
Why don't you sit?
Since when have you started smoking?
- I smoke sometimes. 
When I'm alone
You aren't alone now, aren't you?
Why, who else is here?
Arun will be smoking. 
An ignited matchstick will fall on your dress
Surprised?
Why did you have to do all this?
Don't you have faith in me?
I don't know why, but I was always afraid about losing you
You could've asked me at least.
- Had I the courage to ask...
For something as trivial...
See who it is
No one need come now
Why have you come here?
- I'm going to send you both to jail!
Later! 
Now get out of here!
- No! 
First I'm going inside!
There you are!
Why didn't you come to Metro?
Look, here are the tickets
Did Arun seduce you?
Rogue! 
Look at Prabha ever again, and I'm going to flay you alive!
No need to worry. 
I'm with you.
Come on
I'm not worried. 
And you needn't be here. 
Get it?
We have decided to get married
Now I can rest assured.
- You shut up!
Prabha, what are you saying?
All these are ploys. 
Foisted by him!
This is a lie! 
I'm going to send the two of them to jail! 
You'll see
By all means. 
But must you intrude into such delicate moments?
You have two tickets to the theatre.
Let's watch the movie
As for them, they've taken a decision.
- What decision? 
Why don't you say... all this is a ruse you've worked?
- Not ruse, son. 
This is art
You can call it philosophy, or science.
- Science? 
Bullshit! 
Just ploys... to seduce innocent girls!
The two of them are together... thanks to your ploys. 
And you are the one who will separate them now
Who can separate them? 
Their love is true, they are sincere
They don't need my art, they don't need my ploys
I only show the light to the blind
But where there is light, my little lamp is of no use
After the wedding, make sure you bring Prabha over to my place
And son... the art of getting a grip on your life...
What?
- You won't get to know through letters
Take a month off. 
Come to live with me.
You'll surely find another Prabha
Arun too upheld the legacy of Jackson Tolaram
They married
After the wedding, in accordance with the Colonel's wishes...
Mr and Mrs Arun Pradeep travelled to Khandala to meet Colonel sahib
The Colonel blessed them and he gave them a gift. 1000 Rupees
He returned his fee. 
When truth shines, what use are fees and the art?
Who is this?
Yes, it's Nagesh. 
He has taken a month's leave. 
Leave without pay
He's coming to take lessons from the Colonel sahib
He has a story to tell too.
But that's for later
So Nagesh enlists with the Colonel
Anyway, forget him. 
As of you should send them a congratulatory telegram
Number Eight reads: 
Our best wishes for a happy marriage forever

Henry IV Part II
Written by William Shakespeare.
Here, ho!
Hold!
What's he that goes there?
I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this country.
Duke of Norfolk!
Archbishop of York!
Most royal imp of fame!
- The young prince hath misled me!
- 'Tis so.
And he my dog.
Helter-skelter have I rode to thee.
Never so few, and never yet more need.
Is your master here in London?
- On two leathern jerkins?
- Yea.
A good wit will make use of any thing.
- What!
- You'll crack a quart together, ha!
I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility.
Through Gloucestershire...
- Where have you been this while?
- We steal upon them.
In London? 
That can hardly be.
- What's this?
- 'Tis Gaultree Forest.
As far as France, I heard a bird so sing, or it will seek me in another place.
Nay, they will be kin to us.
How now!
Rain within doors and none abroad?
Not so, my lord.
Albeit I could tell thee.
- I cannot well perceive how.
- Hold hook and line, say I.
Very hardly upon such a subject.
For in every thing, the purpose must weigh with the folly.
Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead?
'Tis no matter.
Tell thou the Earl that the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
That light and weightless down perforce must move, her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.
I beseech you!
- Is't not so?
- By my troth, I care not!
A' shall answer it.
Some pigeons, Davy.
A couple of short-legged hens.
But in new silk and old sack.
- 'Tis with my mind.
- 'Tis so, indeed.
What said Master Dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and slops?
That makes a still-stand, running neither way, which cannot go but thirty mile a-day.
That he should draw his several strengths together!
Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be had.
Like a rib of steel, to make strength stronger.
- Hanging on Hotspur's neck?
- Yea.
O, give me the spare men!
O, give me the spare men!
Seven groats.
- Here I yield him.
- Seven groats.
- Not that I am dead!
- What's this?
- Here's four Harry ten shillings.
- Not that I am dead!
- Though that be sick, it dies not.
- Why, he is dead.
- No, no, my lord!
- Not so.
- He cannot long hold out.
- Better than I was!
The apoplexy will certain be his end.
Is this proceeding just and honourable?
- I had as lief be hanged as go!
- What a maidenly man-at-arms!
- I confess, I cannot help.
- I am well.
- For my old dame's sake.
- I cannot.
You can do it, sir. 
He is retired.
I must a dozen mile to-night.
- When, I pray you, sir?
- O' Thursday.
- Ho! 
Who knocks?
- By cock and pie, you shall not.
- Not able to invent anything?
- Happy am I!
- I thank thee with all my heart.
- O' Thursday.
- Who's here?
- Falstaff's men, as I think.
- How now?
- Bunches of keys at their girdles.
- Old Mistress!
- Fellow!
Give me pardon, sir.
What's he that goes there?
- Two and twenty.
- What's this?
I am only old in judgment and understanding.
- Doth any name particular belong?
- My name is Colevile.
- I never knew.
- Did not care.
You must excuse me.
God forbid, sir, but...
I will not excuse you, you shall not be excused.
- I am the King's poor cousin, sir.
- My king! 
My Jove!
How is this derived?
In deeds dishonourable.
Ever in the rearward of the fashion, when means and lavish manners meet together.
- If I have any vantage of ground...
- Look about, Davy.
- How doth the good knight?
- May I ask how my lady doth?
I am the king's poor cousin.
Who keeps the gate here, ho?
- Which king?
- Of England.
- What pagan may that be?
- Such kin as the parish heifers.
I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus, I never knew.
Now the Lord lighten thee!
Thou art a great fool.
How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard...
- As if there were nothing else.
- I speak the truth.
I beseech you, stand to me.
Who keeps the gate here, ho?
Honest Ned, none.
- Under which king?
- None, Ned, none.
What?
We are a body strong enough to equal with the king.
Call we our high court of parliament.
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel at Clement's Inn, by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service.
- A two-fold operation...
- Be quiet!
- For God's sake, be quiet!
- Up, vanity! 
Down, royal state!
- Why, there spoke a king.
- A foutre for thine office!
- It not belongs to you.
- How comes that?
The butcher's wife, neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, whose bosom burns, to us the imagined voice of God himself that I am a proper fellow of my hands.
Then plain and right must my possession be.
A poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house is no excuse.
With well-appointed powers, he is a man who with double surety binds, and it proceeds from policy, not love.
Be quiet!
Doth this become your place, your time and business
- because you have been so lewd?
- Be quiet!
And then imagine me taking your part, and never live to show the incredulous world!
For God's sake, be quiet! 
Be quiet!
See now, whether entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong.
Be quiet!
Good people, bring a rescue or two!
- Thou bastardly rogue!
- Dost thou hear?
Thou see'st with peril I have answered.
The thewes, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man!
I am Robert Shallow, a poor esquire of this county.
I would have you served with the best to be a cold soldier.
What say thou to it?
Wilt thou? 
Wilt thou?
I could be sad, and sad indeed too.
- Follow no further now.
- What's this?
Follow no further now.
I will not use many words with you.
Death is certain.
Go to, stand aside!
I will bar no honest man.
Very well!
- Do ye yield, sir?
- 'Tah', would a' say.
- He you not hurt i' the groin?
- No, I warrant you.
- A' made a thrust at your belly.
- By my troth, I care not.
- You lie!
- Come, you she knight-errant!
I came, saw, and overcame!
O God, that right should thus overcome...
- Come, you rascal.
- Wo't ta?
I will have you!
Let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
I weary thee?
O foolish youth! 
And dead almost.
- It is often so, indeed.
- Look you!
It never yet did hurt.
- Hold!
- Bullcalf!
Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
Come, I charge you both!
- Thou wo't, wo't ta?
- Come here, Pistol!
- What tell you me of it?
- A man can die but once!
You'll be a fool still.
He saw me, and yielded, that I may justly say!
Come, you thin thing!
I'll tell you what. 
Let us withdraw.
Follow me, Ned.
How swiftly will this Feeble run off!
Come, you rogue, come, bring me to a justice.
I'll tickle your catastrophe!
London. 
A street.
Here's Wart!
See her damned!
See her damned! 
Here's Wart!
Let the fiend give fire!
- Is she of the wicked?
- She is pistol proof, sir.
Come hither, hostess.
There's none such here.
There's none such here.
But in vile apparel.
- Your son did thus and thus.
- Not so, my lord.
He gave it like a rude prince.
- Well, be honest.
- That I may justly say.
- That errant malmsey-nose?
- His hat, but he hath forgot that.
- Didst thou?
- No, no!
In some respects.
She comes blubbered.
What accites your most worshipful thought to think so?
A beard grow in the palm of my hand.
How do you now?
Better than I was, hem!
Let the fiend give fire!
Be quiet! 
Be quiet!
The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap.
- What say you to it?
- It never yet did hurt.
What tell you me of it?
Tortures vile!
Whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked?
- More rushes!
- Boots!
The reason?
- Because you have been so lewd?
- Well said!
- How do you now?
- You make fat rascals.
Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth?
O Lord, ay!
Doth it turn and ebb back to the sea?
- No, not so.
- Throw the quean in the channel!
Doth nothing but roast malt-worms?
- Cakes!
- Apple-johns?
- Small beer?
- Gravy, gravy, gravy!
- Mouldy stewed prunes!
- Dining-chambers!
- Metal.
- A Barbary hen.
'Tis so.
And so, if her feathers turn back,
she must be old.
Therefore...
Scullion!
- A Barbary hen!
- A Barbary hen!
The purpose must weigh with the folly.
Let the fiend give fire!
Take them away!
Away, you scullion!
Be it as it is.
I have long dream'd of such a kind of man, so surfeit-swell'd.
I am the king's poor cousin, sir.
My most royal liege!
Will it please your grace to go along with us and commit the oldest sins?
O pardon me, my liege!
- What's your name, sir?
- Master Bardolph.
And dub me knight, Samingo,
Esquire of this county.
Simon Shadow!
Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown.
We've a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.
Ralph Mouldy.
Thomas Wart.
I commend you well.
Francis Feeble, as valiant as the wrathful dove, or most magnanimous mouse, washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks.
O, give me always a little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot.
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds, through the chamber where we stay'd.
Your likeliest men.
And I myself know well how troublesome it say upon my head.
It is a wonderful thing to see.
Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
- Yea, my lord.
- But look!
- Warwick!
- Warwick!
But that's no marvel.
By my troth, welcome to London.
Let us take any man's horses!
These six dry, round, old, withered knights and lusty lads roam here and there so merrily.
We shall do nothing but eat, and make good cheer.
These six dry, round, old, withered knights.
Thou dost give me flattering busses.
Not worth a gooseberry.
For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing.
In England the most valiant.
Quick, forgetive.
Put on leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon him at his table.
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds.
I stand the push of your one thing.
Let that suffice. 
Let us sway on.
- For these foolish officers.
- Right.
Davy, Davy.
Most royal imp of fame!
Hang him, swaggering rascal!
I cannot abide swaggerers.
- You must excuse me.
- You shall not be excused.
I have borne, and borne, and have been fubbed off, and fubbed off.
- Wherefore blush you now?
- I spied his eyes.
Peace, good Doll!
Do not speak like a death's-head.
- Will you not!
- Yes, sir.
Humphrey, my son of Gloucester, there's a tester for thee, let the end try the man.
- It will be an excellent stratagem.
- It is good, yea, indeed it is.
There 'tis, boy.
A parcel-gilt goblet.
Learn this, Thomas, see if thou canst find out Sneak's noise.
But to the purpose and so to the venture.
- God's blessing of your good heart!
- And praise God for the merry year!
Hold!
Good morrow!
Good morrow!
Hie thee! 
Who, he?
A good-limbed fellow, young, strong, and of good friends.
Who keeps the gate here, ho?
Who keeps the gate here?
Good Master Fang.
Go, pluck him by the elbow, upon the power and puissance of the king.
If without him we be thought too feeble
England shall give him office, honour, might.
I thank your pretty sweet wit for it.
But look you pray.
He may keep his own.
- What's this?
- Thy peach-coloured ones!
You mistake me, sir.
'Tis very true.
If I do feign.
How might we see?
You shall not!
Thou art a very ragged wart.
I know not your breeding.
From every region, apes of idleness!
- What tell you me of it?
- About thy business, Davy!
Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?
So, so, thou common dog!
Away, you mouldy rogue, away!
I charge you with a cup of sack!
You whoreson, chops.
- This is a poor mad soul.
- Thou must not be in this humour...
I cannot endure such a fustian rascal, thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig!
I kiss thy neaf!
Thy mother's son, and thy father's shadow!
There are other men fitter?
Away! 
Or I will ride thee o' nights like the mare.
Fie! 
What man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
If you be not swinged, I'll...
Jesu!
Right!
Go forth!
Run! 
Run!
Hang him, baboon!
Comfort, your majesty.
- What?
- Like a horse.
Let me see.
Instruct us, boy, what dream, boy?
The prince and Master Poins anon, will put on two of our jerkins and aprons, one power against the French.
He leaves his back unarm'd.
Who should lead his force hither?
King Henry IV in his nightgown, with a Page.
Sit down and...
Come on, I'll tell thee what...
Fly from the field!
- Learn this, Thomas. 
Take note.
- Look to 't!
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair.
The French and Welsh baying him at the heels.
Every minute now should be the father of some stratagem if God doth give successful end to this debate that bleedeth.
And so, with great imagination, better satisfied how in our means we should advance.
This is the news at full.
Poins!
Another part of the forest.
Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
Came spurring hard a gentleman, almost forspent with speed, puffed up with this retinue.
Bravely is to come halting off, you know.
O wondrous him!
O miracle of men!
Turning the word to sword and life to death.
Gravy, gravy, gravy.
Then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds.
Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
To come off the breach with his pike bent bravely.
And to surgery bravely.
His flesh was capable of wounds, his pike bent, his ears cut off.
His poor jade up to the rowel-head, his poll clawed...
Less noise, less noise!
Look about, Davy.
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means.
Is't such a matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
What's he that goes there?
A most furious knight and valorous enemy...
Be quiet! 
None, my lord.
- I am passing light in spirit.
- What say you to it?
To sword and...
Be quiet!
Nothing without sack.
To borrow a mess of vinegar.
That can hardly be!
I am a true knight.
- At the round table?
- 'Tis so.
- I banish thee, on pain of death.
- Is't so?
- I cannot think.
- What think you?
- Murder.
- Let them go.
Be quiet! 
And now thou!
Draw, Bardolph, cut me off the villain's head!
- Hang yourself!
- Yea, for my sake!
- His tongue sounds ever after.
- You take not the heat.
- What's this?
- Thou disgorge.
You have drunk too much canaries.
- Because you have been so lewd.
- Let's drink together friendly.
Quoit him down.
Then feed, and be fat.
- Not that.
- O' mine honour, no abuse.
- Let's beat him before his whore.
- Yea!
- The rascal's gone.
- Fled from me like quicksilver.
Retreat is made and execution stay'd.
Hurries toward his home.
You mistake me, sir.
And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble, the woman's tailor, run!
- Of those that turn'd their backs.
- Not so!
And in his flight, stumbling in fear.
- No, no, no, not so.
- He leaves his back unarm'd.
- You lie!
- Furious knight and valorous enemy.
O never!
The wet sea-boy in an hour so rude.
Look to the door there!
Look to the door there!
Look to the door there!
I' good faith!
Hie thee!
Welcome, my tall fellow.
Welcome to London.
The pox pinches?
I would to God my name were not so terrible.
Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
The heavens thee guard and keep?
- What's this?
- The Prince of Wales! 
Where is he?
Sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.
- Mouldy! 
Wart!
- Here, here!
Patch up thine old body for heaven.
By God's liggens, I thank thee.
Away, varlets!
You have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.
You were called "lusty Shallow" then?
A gentleman well bred.
By the mass, I was called any thing.
- Come, come!
- I beseech you!
Where's the roll? 
Let me see!
My lord, this is a poor mad soul!
Lo, here it sits.
What foolish master taught you these manners?
I am here, full of heaviness, so dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone.
You see, my good wenches, our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey, there is nobody cares.
That it is a shame.
Sweating with desire, thinking of nothing else.
How men of merit are sought after.
Come, come, come, off with your boots!
- The young king is sick for me!
- Nothing but well to thee.
The immortal part needs a physician.
Then happy low, lie down.
Whose mare's dead?
What's the matter?
What trade art thou?
With all appliances and means to boot.
Sweetheart, lie thou there.
Well, God mend him! 
I pray you.
- Be cool'd.
- There is no need of any such.
Must you be blushing?
- Though that be sick, it dies not.
- I beseech you.
No more of that!
- I will not be your suitor!
- Silence to bed!
No more, nay!
Where's the roll? 
I saw it!
- There's none such here.
- But these mine eyes saw him!
- I saw it...
- Hie thee.
I am the king's poor cousin, sir.
- You must excuse me.
- Whither away?
Where is the crown?
Lo, here it sits!
No, no, no, not so!
- The fiend!
- What's this?
Is she of the wicked?
She is in hell already, and burns poor souls.
- 'Tis not ten years gone.
- Canst thou deny it?
Is thine hostess here of the wicked?
God send the wench no worse fortune!
My fear is your displeasure.
Our watch-word was 'Hem boys!
'
I am glad of it.
For thy humours, there's not a better.
I have heard better.
Wilt thou make as many holes in battle as thou hast in a petticoat?
To the purpose!
To the purpose!
To the purpose!
As to one, it pleases me.
To the purpose!
Is she of the wicked?
God send the wench no worse fortune!
Whether she be damned for that, I know not.
Answer in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this woman.
A foutre!
After you have laboured so hard you should talk.
- Do this, and fig me.
- Do me, do me.
I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.
After this cold considerance, sentence me.
Very well.
- Sir John!
- Ho.
You loiter here too long!
- No, not so!
- Away, you scullion!
- 'Tis so.
- We will lead on to higher fields!
Happy am I!
- I must wait upon my lord here!
- Let me have him to sit under!
- Come, no more words of it.
- I know how to handle you!
Let him not 'scape.
I think we are a body strong enough.
Never so few, never yet more need.
Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge, full hogshead?
Cankers!
- You live in great infamy.
- Nay, not so much.
- With danger there.
- But I must go and meet with danger.
- Fears too certain.
- My lord, my humble duty remembered.
- You must away to court, sir.
- Let me have five hundred.
- But the disease is incurable.
- Puff!
Not so.
Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field.
But the gout galls the one, and the pox pinches the other.
The Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland, scarcely off a mile, with youthful wings is flown.
But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better.
And more and less do flock to follow him.
If like an ill venture it come unluckily home...
To the purpose!
Our humble author will continue the story, in which you, father, shall have foremost hand,
I heard a bird so sing, whose music, to my thinking...
This man's brow foretells the nature of a tragic volume?
Where sups he?
Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
He holds his place.
A place deep enough.
And lusty lads roam here and there?
For, lo! 
Within a ken, lies the head that wears a crown, which blows no man to good.
Where is the crown?
To the block of death!
The windmill in Saint George's field?
What shall I say you are?
- He which says the dead is not!
- Not he which says the dead is not!
- 'Tis so.
- Who's here?
I will maintain the word with my sword, by yea and nay!
Turning the word to sword and life to death.
Grant of our most just and right desires.
We are in the vaward of our youth and sweating with desire to see him.
We will eat a last year's pippin, if you give o'er.
- What is your good pleasure with me?
- Give me...
Shallow's orchard!
What!
I beseech you!
Well, you shall have it.
Give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw, or the other plays the rogue with my great toe.
Your demands are just.
My lord, we will do so.
- One that draws.
- For certain.
- As good as heart can wish.
- Yea.
Go forth!
Hold! 
Hold!
Away, you mouldy rogue!
Do, do, thou rogue!
You filthy bung, away!
Fie! 
This is hot weather.
Young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
The ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom.
- These fly-bitten tapestries?
- No, no, no, not so.
London. 
The Boar's-head Tavern in Eastcheap.
- There is your crown.
- Madam...
I am the fellow.
Master Shallow, no more of that.
If you knew what pains I have bestow'd to breed this.
We first survey the plot.
How troublesome it sat upon my head, to mock the expectation of the world.
Into the sea! 
What do we then but draw anew the model.
All the soil of the achievement goes with me into the earth.
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea.
Four of which you please.
'Fore God, you have here, a goodly dwelling and a rich.
- Well, I am loath to...
- What?
But my lungs are wasted so!
For God's sake, be quiet.
Thou art to marry his sister Nell.
There's not a better wench in England.
But I am thrust upon it.
- Mistress Doll...
- Clarence.
Though thou stand'st more sure than I could do, thou art not firm enough!
I cannot endure such a fustian rascal.
O foolish youth!
What's the matter?
A proper gentlewoman.
And those two things, land and beefs.
I know, but I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly,
it is a wonderful thing.
Peace!
Marry, I tell thee.
Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
Officers!
He that wears the crown immortally, long guard it yours!
No, I will sit and watch here by the king.
Till his face be like a wet cloak.
Till you do live to see a son of mine.
Stay but a little.
Let him not 'scape.
- Doth the king call?
- Yea, indeed.
He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
This from thee will I to mine leave.
As 'tis left to me.
'Tis so?
- O, if...
- What say you to it?
Was this easy?
Hold him sure, good Master Snare, let him not 'scape.
'Tis so?
Will't please your grace to go along with us?
No, no, no. 
Hold him sure.
To be accommodated, which is an excellent thing.
If thou gettest any leave of me...
- Hold him sure, good Master Snare.
- Till these rebels now afoot...
- Me alone.
- Leave us here alone.
- Come hither.
- Come hither.
- Right?
- Sir, you shall not away tonight.
Let him not 'scape.
Sir, pardon?
Let him not 'scape.
- The Prince of Wales!
- Let him not 'scape.
Yea, marry, there's the point, but if without him.
I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give me your doublet.
- Is't so?
- 'Tis so, indeed.
Right.
- Whither away?
- Coming to look on you.
No, no, no, not so, let him not 'scape.
'Accommodo' very good.
Less noise, less noise!
Get on thy boots!
And no food!
Go, wash thy face.
- Exceeding good command!
- I thank thee.
And again would a' come, and away again would a' go!
'Bounce' would a' say!
Follow me, Ned!
There's a letter for you.
Yet speak, Morton!
"To Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
"I have drunk too much sack.
"Must I marry your sister?
"Good people, bring a rescue or two.
"In the windmill in Saint George's field."
I have heard the word!
Like unto the sign of the leg!
O sweet Pistol! 
Slain outright!
Not that I am dead.
A' drew a good bow, and dead!
I think we are a body strong enough.
Ah, sirrah.
- I am your shadow, I'll follow you.
- Mouldy, stay at home.
I will bid you good night, in my pure and immaculate...
- Valour?
- Valour!
- Being sick, have made me well.
- Well, sweet Jack, have a care.
Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
Yea.
- Good morrow.
- Good morrow.
Follow no further now...
I will stoop and humble my intents.
I come to... 
Pardon me, sir.
- Have you read over the letters?
- Well, my lord.
- A rescue! 
A rescue!
- See what...
I have drawn it in my fantasy.
I know the young king is sick for me...
Hold! 
Hold!
- What's he that goes there?
- My lord, your son!
- Not thou.
- I am Robert Shallow, sir.
- A rescue!
- Let that suffice.
There hath been a man or two lately killed.
O, pardon me.
- Indeed, sir, to my cost.
- You must excuse me.
Never fear that.
We ready are to try our fortunes.
To see how many of my old acquaintance are dead.
- By'r lady, I think a' be.
- I can get no remedy against this.
Make friends with speed!
- Brother, son, and all are dead.
- I mean not to.
- For the man is dead that you beat.
- O majesty! 
Did he suspire?
A good heart's worth gold.
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord...
Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
Here!
- I am, sir, under the king.
- A goodly dwelling and a rich.
- Has he land and beefs.
- Is't so?
Give me your hand, sir!
- Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
- Thou'rt a good fellow.
Come on!
I mean not to sweat extraordinarily.
Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I have spent!
Never fear that.
The perfumed chambers of the great, under the canopies of costly state.
- He is coming hither!
- Boys and beggary.
Hold!
- I beseech you!
- O, pardon me.
Headstrong riot hath no curb.
You must excuse me.
I see him break Skogan's head!
Peace! 
Peace!
From the court!
Let him come in.
A most furious knight and valorous enemy.
Take heed what guests you receive.
- Hie thee.
- He stabbed me!
Peace! 
Peace!
This strained passion doth you wrong.
Let's drink together friendly and embrace.
God witness with me when they marry.
Alas! 
Prince Harry, slain outright.
Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead, for the gain proposed.
- For Oldcastle died a martyr...
- He'll straight be well.
Almost wounded to the death...
He'll recover without physic.
That our great-grandsire, whose fever-weaken'd joints, like strengthless hinges, buckle under life...
Dead, sir!
I pray thee, gentle daughter, give even way unto my rough affairs, in the laws of this land-service.
That the united vessel of their blood, between that royal field, and Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John...
But Harry lives!
- Say not that Percy's dead.
- Not that I am dead.
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state.
- So God save me, la!
- How is this derived?
I speak to thee, my heart.
Reply not to me with a fool-born jest!
No more of that!
A merry song, come!
A merry song, come!
Let us make head!
A' must, then, to the inns...
Shortly?
Shortly!
Puff!
It is a wonderful thing to see.
Only, we want a little personal strength.
Old pike!
A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner to buy a saddle.
- Whose son art thou?
- The king's justices of the peace.
No, Good Captain Pistol, not here.
Unless you give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw,
I may say to you, nay.
Do your offices.
If you do not all show like gilt twopences to me.
No, faith, boys, none!
- Ha!
- No, no, no.
- Nay!
- Very singular good!
Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course?
Let me see... 
Yea.
What trust is in these times?
What a life dost thou lead!
O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows.
Speak of me even now, gasping for life under great Bolingbroke.
- What trade art thou, Feeble?
- Well, a woman's tailor, sir.
I am Robert Shallow.
Able to invent anything.
Nay, you shall see my orchard.
'Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.
But look you pray.
What's this?
To us no more, nay, not so much.
'Rah, tah, tah, ' would a' say, 'bounce' would a' say.
There's a tester for thee.
What tell you me of it?
Another part of the forest!
Another part of the forest!
And put the world's whole strength into one giant arm, like a forked radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it.
A head!
After you have laboured so hard, cut me off the villain's head, with a Barbary hen!
- We shall do nothing!
- I beseech you!
With a Barbary hen!
It cannot be, my lord.
- I have heard the word.
- What's this?
I cannot tell. 
It is even so.
Who hath not heard it spoken.
Phrase call you it?
By this good day, I know not the phrase.
- Ha! 
Again!
- Is't so?
Not so.
How in our means we should advance ourselves?
Here comes my servant Travers!
Retreat is made and execution stay'd.
And in his flight, stumbling in fear, washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks.
- If my heart be not read to burst.
- I have heard the word!
Now, have you left pursuit?
Puff! 
Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base.
- No, no, no, not so.
- Ha! 
Again.
I was at your back, yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.
But this is mere digression from my purpose.
- No more words!
- For God's sake!
- Ha! 
Again.
- Right.
Now a' said so.
Indeed, sir, to my cost.
That's fifty-five.
Young Prince John and Westmoreland and Stafford came sighing on after the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
I was before Master Tisick, the debuty, t'other day, and he said, before Shallow's house.
Enter Shallow and Silence, meeting, and ever among so merrily.
In loathsome beds, great friends did feast together,
and make good cheer.
Two years after.
- So in hope as in an early spring.
- Ay!
Shadow will serve for summer.
The seasons change their manners.
As the year had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.
O, such a day...
Hem boys!
Go forth!
What shall I say you are?
Of Hotspur Coldspur?
I am a gentleman.
What's your name, sir?
That furious Scot, the bloody...
Douglas.
Greeting.
Harry, Prince of Wales, greeting.
- Be it known to you?
- 'Tis so.
Thou seek'st the greatness.
You are too great to be by me gainsaid.
'Tis so.
We have sent forth already.
And send discoverers forth.
'Tis so, indeed.
And howl'st to find it.
- From this day to that day.
- A great while.
Any thing indeed would do
very well.
A word with you...
I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
But prate to me of the...
What?
- The crown?
- As I think.
- Yea.
- Yea.
Yea!
- I thank thee.
- Excellent good.
Sir, but yet, God forbid, sir, but...
Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.
East, west, north, south, a place deep enough, wherein it shall appear the throng of words
make the case yours.
Know you where?
Go forth!
My judgment is, we should not step too far!
For by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature so dull, so dead in look, he will spare neither man, woman, nor child!
The canker'd heaps by the rood!
So, I pray you, if you give o'er to stormy passion, death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all, and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth.
My lord, this is a poor, mad soul.
Bardolph, look to our horses.
Will you command me to use my legs?
Dispatch!
Lo, here it sits!
Here, Pistol, stand behind me.
- How now!
- Come on, sir, give me your hand.
Ah, sirrah!
What's this?
There 'tis, boy.
- Where is he?
- Behold!
Before you?
'Tis so!
You fat fool!
- What?
- In these tirrits and frights!
He is furnish'd with no certainties.
It is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.
My lord, I over-rode him on the way!
He seem'd in running to devour the way!
- Puff in thy teeth!
- He cares not the mischief he does!
You muddy conger!
- Take heed of him!
- Fie, fie, fie! 
Will I live?
With joints of steel...
Full of nimble fiery...
- Goodman bones!
- Cut me off the villain's head!
Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
Look!
Jesu!
- I told thee!
- Ha! 
Again.
You were advised his flesh was capable of wounds and scars.
Thy tender lambkin now is king.
That you use the same with the like bold...
Be quiet!
Go forth!
Fly from the field!
How many of my old acquaintance are dead?
- Francis Pickbone.
- Will Squele.
- Five more.
- Three!
It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?
Be quiet. 
Go, wash thy face.
Let it do something, my good lord, and call it what you will.
How now?
Well...
Hath the Prince John a full commission?
- That we have, in faith.
- As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
The box of the ear that the prince gave you.
Bring up his powers.
- How now?
- I know not.
What says the almanac?
King Henry IV Part 2. 
Act 5. 
Scene I
"And, putting off his hat, said,
"'God's blessing of your good heart,
"he would make this a bloody day to somebody,
"by my faith.'
"Now, the Lord bless that sweet face of thine.
"Great friends did feast together, upon mouldy stewed prunes,
"a good dish of prawns, a score of good ewes..."
Come, it grows late.
"And I may say to you,
"'We first survey the plot,
"Then my courtesy,
"and more and less.
"About three of the clock in the afternoon,
"in three divided.
"Four of which you please,
"to five and twenty thousand.
"There were five more.
"Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand,
"then threw he down himself and all their lives,
"towards fronting peril,
"that the wicked might not fall in love with him."'
- Sirrah.
- Sirrah.
Right.
Kiss me, Doll!
- Three!
- Three!
There 'tis, boy!
- What is the news, my lord?
- Like a strange tongue.
- Master Dumbe, our minister.
- Base Assyrian.
But, indeed!
Clement Perkes of the hill!
- 'Tis so, indeed!
- What is the news, my lord?
"Here at more leisure may our highness read,
"the throng of words that come.
"A most furious knight and valorous enemy
"may peruse the men
"in all the inns o'."
What!
"The inns o'."
What's this?
He hath found to end one doubt by death.
- Much!
- Why, here it is.
Dead! 
A' would have clapped i' the clout at twelve score!
For look you how be writes!
- He'll be crowing as if he had writ.
- One word more, I beseech you?
A' do nothing but
"o'."
He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.
- And of what place, I pray?
- In Europe.
In the windmill in Saint George's field?
- Saint Alban's.
- Yea-forsooth.
God bless thy lungs, good knight.
This doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
- Ah, sirrah! 
Quoth-a.
- 'Tis so, indeed.
O God!
The blunt monster with uncounted heads...
O, run, Doll, run!
O, fly to Scotland!
He doth unfasten.
As he is striking hope gives not so much warrant as despair.
When the man of action is called on.
And winking, leap'd into destruction.
From whence with life he never more sprung up.
And since we are o'erset, venture again.
- There 'tis, boy!
- The block of death.
Yea, joy.
Look, whether the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot.
- How now?
- He will spare not man nor child.
Let him be brought in to his answer...
- In three divided.
- In three divided.
- He that buckles him in my belt...
- In three divided.
In three divided.
May overlive the hazard.
If his weapon be out?
Certain, 'tis certain, very sure, very sure, death.
I cannot go.
- Who should lead his forces hither?
- Sir Ralph Mouldy!
- Yea?
- Mouldy, you shall go.
I would Wart might have gone, sir.
I will leer upon him as a' comes by.
- I will resolve for Scotland...
- Hold.
- Pleaseth your grace to answer...
- Thrice.
As good as heart can wish.
I will sit and watch.
Yea, sir.
Fare you well, go.
Hold!
Answer, thou dead elm, answer, ere this year expire.
I pray you, let me speak with you.
What's your name, sir?
My name is Colevile of the dale.
- What disease hast thou?
- A whoreson cold, sir.
- What says the doctor to my water?
- Pox.
You shall go.
I thank thee with all my heart.
Was this easy!
Hold!
Answer, thou dead elm, answer, ere this year expire.
I pray you, let me speak with you.
- What's your name, sir?
- Sir Ralph Mouldy!
- What disease hast thou?
- A whoreson cold, sir.
What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
I know not!
Hold!
- What's your name, sir?
- Peter Bullcalf o' the green!
- What disease hast thou?
- A whoreson cold, sir.
What says the doctor to my water?
By yea and nay...
What's your name, sir?
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
- What disease hast thou?
- A whoreson cold, sir.
What's a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent?
What's this?
A swallow, an arrow, or a bullet?
I know not.
How comes this, Sir John?
Every man must know that.
Thomas?
Davy!
Lo, here it sits.
Well, harken at the end!
Fall to thy prayers!
God's blessing of your good heart!
If God doth give successful end to...
Jesu!
It is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England and the whores called him mandrake.
Have you your wits?
So idly to profane the precious time!
I am in good name with the very best, look to the door there I' good faith, good, an God will!
How, you fat fool! 
I scorn you, and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up!
His wit's as thick as Tewksbury mustard, alas, poor ape, how thou sweatest!
Come, let me wipe thy face, you basket-hilt stale juggler, you!
In God's name, come, get you down stairs!
Look to the door there!
No! 
For they have marvellous foul linen.
I scorn you, scurvy companion.
You poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate!
If not, we ready are to try our fortunes to the last man.
In God's name then...
Very well!
Away, you cut-purse rascal,
I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps.
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me.
You filthy bung, away!
Thou bastardly rogue!
I beseek you now, aggravate your choler, for you hear not what I say to you, dry, round, old, withered knights!
- Come, we will all put forth!
- O Lord, ay!
Stand to 't!
Bragging Spaniard!
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end!
God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this till you are past service and the tapestry here is return'd.
Which God so frame!
Go forth!
They are your likeliest men.
Let him not 'scape.
Yea, indeed, is it.
Come, will you hence?
Blunt, lead him hence.
Toss the rogue in a blanket.
Come on, come on, come on, sir.
Put up your naked weapons!
Stand from him, fellow.
Let that suffice.
Jesu!

GUARD 1: 
Halt!
GUARD 2: 
Who goes there?
It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons.
Sovereign of all England!
GUARD 1: 
Pull the other one.
I am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy.
We have ridden the length of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.
I must speak with your lord and master.
What? 
Ridden on a horse?
Yes.
You're using coconuts!
What?
You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're banging them together.
So? 
We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land.
Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
Where did you get the coconuts?
We found them.
Found them? 
In Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.
What do you mean?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.
They could be carried.
What? 
A swallow carrying a coconut?
It could grip it by the husk.
It's not a question of where he grips it.
It's a simple question of weight ratio.
A five-ounce bird could not carry a one-pound coconut.
It doesn't matter.
Go tell your master that Arthur from Camelot is here.
GUARD: 
In order to maintain air-speed Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
Please! 
Am I right?
I'm not interested.
GUARD 2: 
It could be carried by an African swallow.
GUARD 1: 
Oh, yes!
An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow.
That's my point.
I agree with that.
Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?
But then, of course, African swallows are non-migratory.
GUARD 2: 
Oh, yes.
They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway.
GUARD 3: 
Wait a minute! 
Supposing two swallows carried it together?
GUARD 4: 
No, they'd have to have it on a line.
GUARD 3: 
Simple. 
They'd use a strand of creeper.
Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
Why not?
MAN: 
Bring out your dead!
(PEOPLE SOBBING)

(MEN MOANING)
Bring out your dead.
Here's one.
Ninepence.
I'm not dead! 
What?
Nothing. 
Here's your ninepence.
I'm not dead!
He says he's not dead.
Yes, he is.
I'm not! 
He isn't?
He will be soon. 
He's very ill.
I'm getting better!
You'll be stone dead in a moment.
I can't take him like that.
It's against regulations.
I don't want to go on the cart.
Don't be such a baby.
I can't take him.
I feel fine.
Well, do us a favour.
I can't.
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won't be long.
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.
When's your next round?
Thursday.
I think I'll go for a walk.
You're not fooling anyone, you know.
Isn't there something you can do?
I feel happy.
(GRUNTS)
Thanks very much.
Not at all.
See you on Thursday.
Right.
Who's that, then?
I don't know. 
Must be a king.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Old woman! 
Man!
Man. 
Sorry. 
What knight lives in that castle over there?
I'm 37.
What?
I'm 37. 
I'm not old.
I can't just call you "man."
You could say "Dennis."
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out.
I did say sorry about the "old woman," but from behind...
What I object to is that you treat me like an inferior.
Well, I am king.
King? 
Very nice.
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!
By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society!
If there's ever going to be any progress...
There's some lovely filth down here.
Oh!
How do you do?
How do you do, good lady? 
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Whose castle is that?
King of the who?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
We all are. 
We're all Britons.
And I am your king.
Didn't know we had a king.
I thought we were an autonomous collective.
You're fooling yourself. 
We're living in a dictatorship.
A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class...
There you go.
Bringing class into it again.
That's what it's all about.
If only people...
Please, good people.
I am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?
No one lives there.
Who is your lord?
We don't have a lord. 
What?
I told you. 
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
We take turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Yes.
But all the decisions of that officer are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
Yes, I see.
By a majority in the case of internal affairs.
Be quiet!
By a two-thirds majority in the case of...
Be quiet!
I order you to be quiet.
"Order." Who does he think he is?
I am your king!
I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
How did you become king then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying, by divine providence, that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
That is why I'm your king!
Listen. 
Strange women lying in ponds, distributing swords, is no basis for a system of government.
Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Be quiet!
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.
Shut up!
If I went around saying I was an emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!
Will you shut up?
See the violence inherent in the system.
Shut up!
See the violence inherent in the system!
Help, I'm being repressed!
Bloody peasant!
What a giveaway.
Did you hear that?
That's what I'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?
You make me sad.
So be it. 
Come, Patsy.
None shall pass.
What? 
None shall pass.
I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Then you shall die.
I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside.
I move for no man.
So be it!
(BELLOWS MENACINGLY)
(SHOUTING)
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
"A scratch"? 
Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that, then?
I've had worse. 
You liar.
Come on, you pansy!
(SHOUTING)
Victory is mine.
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy... (GRUNTS)
Come on, then. 
What?
Have at you.
You are brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is mine.
Oh! 
Had enough, eh?
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.
Yes, I have. 
Look!
Just a flesh wound.
Look, stop that. 
Chicken!
I'll have your leg. 
Right!
Right! 
I'll do you for that.
You'll what?
Come here.
What are you going to do?
Bleed on me?
I am invincible!
You're a loony.
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!
Come on, then.
(MUMBLING)
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Come, Patsy.
Oh, oh, I see.
Running away?
You yellow bastard!
Come back here and take what's coming to you!
I'll bite your legs off!

How do you know she is a witch?
She looks like one.
(PEOPLE AGREEING)

I am not a witch.
But you are dressed as one.
They dressed me up like this.

We didn't!

No.

Yes, a bit. 
She has got a wart.

Well, she turned me into a newt.
A newt?

Burn her anyway.
Burn her!

There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Are there?
What are they? 
Tell us.
Do they hurt?
Tell me, what do you do with witches?

Burn them!
What do you burn apart from witches?
More witches!

Wood.
So, why do witches burn?
'Cause they're made of wood?
Good.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
Build a bridge out of her.
Ah! 
Can you not also make bridges of stone?
Oh, yeah.
Does wood sink in water?

Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege.
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table?
My liege, I would be honoured.
What is your name?
Bedevere, my liege.
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, knight of the Round Table.
NARRATOR: 
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights.
But other illustrious names were soon to follow.
Sir Lancelot the Brave.
Sir Galahad the Pure.
And Sir Robin, the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon ofAngnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill.
And the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries.
The Knights of the Round Table.
That, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.
Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Certainly, sir.
Look, my liege.
Camelot. 
Camelot.
Camelot. 
It's only a model.
Shh!
Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.
Let us ride to Camelot!

Sorry. 
And don't apologise.
Every time I talk to someone it's "sorry this," and, "forgive me that, "
and, "I'm not worthy. ".
What are you doing now?
I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.
Don't. 
It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.
Now, knock it off! 
Yes, Lord.
Right. 
Arthur, King of the Britons.
Your knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.
Good idea, O Lord!
Course it's a good idea.
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.
Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.
That is your purpose, Arthur.
The quest for the Holy Grail.
A blessing from the Lord.
God be praised!
Halt!
(HORN BLARING)
Hello!
Hello!
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Hello. 
Who is it?
It is King Arthur, and these are my knights of the Round Table.
Whose castle is this?
This is the castle of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.
If he will give us food and shelter for the night, he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.
He's already got one, you see.
What?
He says they've already got one!
Are you sure he's got one?
Oh, yes. 
It's very nice.
I told him we've already got one.
(SNICKERING)
Uh, om...
Can we come up and have a look?
Of course not!
You are English-types.
Well, what are you then?
I'm French.
Why do you think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king?
What are you doing in England?
Mind your own business.
If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force.
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!
Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person.
I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King.
You and all your silly English knights.
(RAZZING)
What a strange person.
Now look here, my good man...
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed, animal food-trough wiper.
I fart in your general direction.
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries.
Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
No. 
Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time.
Now, this is your last chance.

DIRECTOR: 
Action!
Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.
The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise.
Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.
Arthur, having consulted his closest knights decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually.
(HOOFBEATS APPROACHING) Now, this is what they did... (BELLOWING)
Frank!
(NARRATOR READING)
So, each of the knights went their separate ways.
Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favourite minstrels.
MINSTREL: 
J" Bravely bold Sir Robin Rode forth from Camelot.
J" He was not afraid to die O, Brave Sir Robin.
J" He was not at all afraid To be killed in nasty ways.
J" Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.
J* He was not in the least bit Scared To be mashed into a pulp.
J" Or to have his eyes gouged out And his elbows broken.
J" To have his kneecaps split And his body burned away.
J* And his limbs all hacked and mangled Brave Sir Robin.
J* His head smashed in And his heart cut out.
J" His liver removed And his bowels unplugged.
J* His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off And his penis...

That's, uh, enough music for now, lads.

Shut up!
Um... 
Oh!
Nothing. 
Nothing, really.
(STAMMERING) Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
I'm afraid not.
Ah.
Actually, I am a knight of the Round Table.
You're a knight of the Round Table?
I am.
In that case, I have to kill you.
Shall I?
I don't think so.
What do I think?
Kill him. 
Let's be nice to him.
Shut up. 
But...
And you!
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!
Cut your own head off.
Yes, do us all a favour.
What? 
Yapping on all the time.
You're lucky you're not next to him.
What do you mean?
You snore.
I don't.
You've got bad breath.
Only because you don't brush my teeth.
Stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!
All right!
We'll kill him first, and then have tea and biscuits.
Yes. 
Not biscuits.
All right! 
Not biscuits.
But let's kill him anyway.
BOTH: 
Right.
He's buggered off!
So he has! 
He's scarpered.
J* Brave Sir Robin ran away.
No!
J* Bravely ran away, away
I didn't.
J* When danger reared its ugly head.

Hello!
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
The Castle Anthrax?
Yes.
It's not a very good name, is it?
Oh, but we are nice, and we will attend to your every, every need!
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
The what?
The Grail. 
It is here?
But you are tired, and you must rest awhile.
Midget! 
Crapper!
MIDGET AND CRAPPER:
Yes, O Zoot?
Prepare a bed for our guest.
Thank you, Zoot.
Thank you.
Away, away, varletesses!
The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.
Look, I, Uh...
What is your name, handsome knight?
Uh, Sir Galahad the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. 
Just Zoot.
Oh, but come.
Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.
You have suffered much.
You are delirious.
Look, I have seen it.
It is here.
Sir Galahad!
You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
(STAMMERING)
Oh!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet, compared to yours.
We're eight score blondes and brunettes, all between 16 and 19 and a half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.
It is a lonely life.
Bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.
We are just not used to handsome knights.
Nay. 
Come. 
You may lie here.
But you are wounded!
No, it's nothing!
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.
Well, what seems to be the trouble?
They're doctors?
Uh, they have a basic medical training.
Come, come, you must try to rest.
Dr Piglet! 
Dr Winston!
Practise your art.
Try to relax.
Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Please. 
We are doctors.
Look, this cannot be.
I am sworn to chastity!
Back to your bed!
Torment me no longer.
I have seen the Grail.
There's no Grail here.
I have seen it.
I have seen... 
WOMEN: 
Hello.
(BECKONINGLY) Hello.
Zoot!
I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
Where are you going?
I seek the Grail.
I have seen it here in this castle!
Oh, no. 
Bad, bad Zoot!
What is it?
Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!
She has been setting light to our beacon, which is Grail-shaped.
It's not the first time we've had this problem.
It's not the real Grail?
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.
She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty.
Do you think this scene should have been cut?
We were so worried when the boys were writing it.
But now we're glad. 
It's better than some previous scenes, I think.
Ours was better visually.
Ours was committed. 
It wasn't a string of pussy jokes.
Get on with it.
Yes. 
Get on with it!
ALL: 
Get on with it!
I am enjoying this scene.
Get on With it!
(SIGHS)
Wicked, wicked Zoot!
She must pay the penalty.
In Castle Anthrax, we have one punishment for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.
You must tie her down on a bed, and spank her.
WOMEN: 
A spanking! 
A spanking!
You must spank her, and after you've spanked her, deal with her as you like.
And, then, spank me.
And me!
And me. 
And me.
Yes. 
You must give us all a good spanking!
WOMEN:

And, after the spanking, the oral sex.

We'll cover your escape!
Look, I'm fine!

I can tackle this lot single-handed!
Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!
(WOMEN CLAMOURING IN AGREEMENT)
No, Sir Galahad. 
Come!
Honestly, I can handle this lot easily!
Yes, let him handle us easily.
Go! 
Quick!
Wait! 
Please! 
I can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!
He'll beat us easily.
We haven't a chance.
(ALL CLAMOURING DISAPPOINTEDLY)
Oh, shit!
You were in great peril.
I don't think I was.
You were in terrible peril.
Let me go back, and face the peril.
No, it's too perilous.
It's my duty to sample as much peril as I can.
We've got to find the Holy Grail.
Let me have just a bit of peril?
No. 
It's unhealthy.
I bet you're 93V-
No, I'm not.
NARRATOR: 
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation.
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.
That's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.
They were more than two laden swallow's flights away.
Four, with a coconut on a line between them.

When I started here, it was a swamp.
Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on the swamp.
But I built it all the same to show them.
It sank into the swamp.
So, I built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.
So, I built a third one.
That burned down, fell over, then sank in the swamp.
But the fourth one stayed up.

And my special guest here today.
Hello.
MAN: 
He killed my auntie!
No, please! 
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.
We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.
But I don't want to think I've lost a son, so much as gained a daughter.
For, since the tragic death of her father...
He's not quite dead!
Since the near fatal wounding of her father...
He's getting better!
For, since her own father who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.
(MAN GROANING)
He's died!
I want his only daughter to look upon me as her own dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense.
And I feel sure that the merger, the union between the Princess and the brave but dangerous Sir Lancelot of Camelot...
What?
Look, the dead Prince!

Old crone!
Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?
Who sent you?
The knights who say "Ni"!
No! 
We have no shrubberies here.
If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say...
We will say "Ni."
(GROANS) Do your worst!
Very well. 
If you will not assist us voluntarily...
Ni! 
No!
Never. 
No shrubberies.
N00! 
Nu.
No, it's not that, it's "Ni."
No, you're not doing it properly.
Ni. 
You've got it.
BOTH: 
Ni!
Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?
Um...
Yes.
What sad times are these when passing ruffians can say "Ni" at will to old ladies.
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.
Even those who arrange shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.
Did you say "shrubberies"?
Yes.
Shrubberies are my trade.
I am a shrubber.
My name is Roger the Shrubber. 
I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
Ni!
No!
Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.
May we go?
It is a good shrubbery.
I like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.
What is that?
We are now no longer the knights who say "Ni."
Shh! 
Shh!
We are now the knights who say,
"Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing"!
Therefore, we must give you a test.
What is this test, knights who until recently said "Ni"?
Firstly, you must find another shrubbery!
Not another shrubbery!
Then you must bring it here beside this shrubbery.
Higher, so you get the two-level effect with a path going down the middle.
OTHERS: 
A path! 
A path!
Then, when you have found the shrubberies, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring!
We shall do no such thing.
Oh, please.
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.
(SCREAMING)
Don't say that word. 
What word?
I cannot tell. 
Suffice to say, it's one of the words the knights of Ni cannot hear.
How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
He did it again.
What? "Ls"?
No, not "is"! 
You wouldn't get very far in life not saying "is."
My liege, it's Robin.

It's good to see you.
Now he's said the word!
You haven't given up your quest for the Holy Grail?

Shut up!
No, far from it.
You said the word again.
I was looking for it.

Gliese 229 (also designated as Gl 229 or GJ 229) is a binary system that has a red dwarf and the first brown dwarf discovered by astronomers. It is located 18.8 light years away in the constellation Lepus. The main star of the binary system has 58% of the mass of the Sun, 69% of the Sun's radius, and a very low projected rotation velocity of 1 km/s at the stellar equator.
The star sometimes randomly gets brighter in luminosity because it is a low activity flare star, which means there is magnetic activity on its surface that causes it to get randomly brighter. It gives off light in the H and K bands due to calcium. It also gives off X-rays from its corona, caused by the interaction between magnetic loops and the gas in its outer atmosphere. There are no large spots on the star that have been detected.
The star is moving through space with a velocity of +12 km/s in the U direction, –11 km/s in the V direction, and –12 km/s in the W direction. Its path around the Milky Way is a little bit squashed, with an eccentricity of 0.07. Its orbit is also tilted just a little bit, with an inclination of 0.005.

History.
Name.
The first tompouce was made by a baker in Amsterdam in 1858. The actor it was named after had gotten his name from another actor, Charles Sherwood Stratton. Stratton called himself Tom Thumb, the literal translation of Tom Pouce. Tom Thumb is a fairy tale about a small man.
What it's known for.
Colour.
The tompouce is often associated with the day the people of the Netherlands celebrate the birthday of their monarch (In Dutch: "Koningsdag"; King's Day). The colour of the icing on top of the pastry is changed for this event. The icing is normally pink, but it is changed to orange. Orange is the national colour of the Netherlands. The orange tompouce is also eaten during large events the Netherlands takes part in, such as the FIFA World Cup. 
Eating.
The tompouce is known for being difficult to eat. When you try to put a fork in it, the cream on the inside tends to spill out. Because of this, the Dutch have come up with many different ways to eat the pastry.

= = = Theloderma = = =
Theloderma, the bug-eyed frogs, mossy frogs, or warty frogs, is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, subfamily Rhacophorinae. They live in northeastern India and southern China, through Southeast Asia, to the Greater Sunda Islands; the highest species richness is in Indochina. Some species, especially "T. corticale", can live in captivity, with humans.
They are small and medium-sized frogs with maximum snout–vent lengths that range from . Their skin can be smooth or it can have warts or bumps on it. Some of the species look very different from each other, but most have good camouflage: Their colors make them look like plants or bird droppings so that animals that want to eat them cannot see them.
Scientists do not know much about what these frogs do, but they eat small animals without bones, for example insects. Scientists have seen some of these species lay eggs in small pools of water in holes in trees, in bamboo, or in karst rocks. The female lays 4–20 eggs just above the water. After about one to two weeks they hatch into tadpoles that fall into the water. They become small frogs after a few months or a year.
Species and taxonomy.
The sister taxon of "Theloderma" is "Nyctixalus". Scientists have changed their minds about exactly which species should be in the genus "Theloderma" and which in "Nyctixalus", especially with "Theloderma moloch". Today both AmphibiaWeb and Amphibian Species of the World say the two genera are both good.
Amphibian Species of the World says there are 26 species in the genus "Theloderma":

= = = Castor (star) = = =
Castor is the second brightest object in the zodiac constellation of Gemini. It has the Bayer designation � Geminorum, which is Latinised to Alpha Geminorum and shortened to Alpha Gem or � Gem. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.93, which makes it one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Castor appears as a single star to the naked eye, but it is actually a sextuple star system (six stars) organized into three binary pairs of stars designated Castor A, Castor B and Castor C, each containing two stars. Even though it is the '�' (alpha) member of the constellation, it is fainter than '�' (beta) Geminorum, Pollux.
Stellar system.
Castor is a multiple star system made up of six different stars; there are three visual stars, all of which are spectroscopic binaries. Appearing as a single star to the naked eye, Castor was first recorded as a double star in 1718 by James Pound, but it may have been changed into at least two sources of light by Cassini as early as 1678. The separation between the binary systems Castor A and Castor B has increased from about 2′′ (2 arcseconds of angular measurement) in 1970 to about 6′′ in 2017.
 These stars have magnitudes of 1.9 and 3.0, respectively.
Castor Aa and Ba both have orbits of a few days with a much fainter star.
Castor C, or YY Geminorum, was discovered to change in brightness with a regular period. It is an eclipsing binary with additional changes due to areas of different brightness on the surface of one or both stars, as well as irregular flares. The Castor C stars orbit in less than a day. Castor C is believed to be in a orbit around Castor AB, but with an extremely long period of several thousand years. It is 73′′ distant from the bright stars in the system
The combined apparent magnitude of all six stars is +1.58.

This process went to Italian-born composer Giuseppe Donizetti, who was also the composer of first Ottoman Imperial anthem – "Mahmudiye Marşı", and second – "Mecidyie Marşi". Mehmed VI, the last Ottoman sultan didin't choose a special march composed for him but rather chose to use the “Mahmudiye”.
Lyrics.
Only the "Hamidiye Marşı" and "Reşadiye Marşı" used to have lyrics, the first three anthems were completly instrumental. The lyrics of the "Reşadiye Marşı" seem to have been lost to history.
Hamidiye Marşı.
Ey velîni'met-i âlem şehinşâh-ı cihan&lt;br&gt;
Taht-ı âlî baht-ı Osmaniye verdin izz ü şan&lt;br&gt;
Sâye-i lûtf-i hümayûnunla âlem kâm-ran&lt;br&gt;
Saltanatta çok zaman Sultan Hamid zevk et heman&lt;br&gt;
Çok yaşa ey padişahım devletinle çok yaşa&lt;br&gt;
Çok yaşa ey padişahım şevketinle çok yaşa&lt;br&gt;

= = = Quaternary numeral system = = =
A quaternary numeral system uses the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3 to represent any real number. It is a base-4 system, which means it works in a similar way to how we count in regular decimal numbers, but with only four possible digits. Converting from binary (a base-2 system) to quaternary is easy.
The number four is a useful choice for a base in counting because it is the highest number that can be quickly recognized without counting each item one by one (subitizing). It is also both a square number and a highly composite number (in the same way 36 is), making it quite easy. Despite being twice as large as binary, it has the same radix economy for counting. However, it is not the best choice for identifying prime numbers (the smallest better choice being the primorial base six, or senary).
Quaternary is like other numeral systems with a fixed-radix in that it has certain properties, such as the capability to represent any real number using a standard representation that is almost unique. Additionally, it has similar characteristics for the representation of irrational and rational numbers as systems like decimal or binary. See discussions on binary and decimal for more information on these properties.

TRAPPIST-1d, also known as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 d, is a small exoplanet which is about 40% the mass of the Earth. It orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone of the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. It is located 40.7 light years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, which means the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The first information about the planet were announced in 2016, but it wasn't until the following years that more information about the likely nature of the planet was obtained. TRAPPIST-1d is the second-least massive planet of the TRAPPIST-1 system and is likely to have a thin hydrogen-poor atmosphere that is closely packed together similar to Venus, Earth, or Mars. It gets just 4.3% more sunlight than how much sunlight the Earth gets from the sun, placing it on the inner edge of the habitable zone. It has about less than 5% of its mass as a volatile layer, which could consist of atmosphere, oceans, and/or ice layers. A 2018 study by the University of Washington came to a opinion that TRAPPIST-1d might be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere. The planet is an eyeball planet candidate.

The Palm (also known as Palm Springs or La Palma or Senza Titolo) is a 20th-century late Pop art iconic painted in enamel on canvas by Mario Schifano. It was painted about 1987, in Rome, Italy. Palm trees are Schifano's most iconic and significant subject, like Fontana's cuts.
History.
In 1987 in Milano, Mario Schifano aroused the enthusiasm and emotion of the public for the "No title" art work that represent a palm.
The work aims to be a denunciation of environmental protection and an awareness of sustainability inspired by the principles of advertising.
The painting executed in the mid eighty, represents the typical figure of a palm tree, with the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag, enriched by pink which is one of the most precious colors of Schifano. Schifano with Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein is considered the founder of pop art.
This work is registered in the Archivio Monica Schifano, Mario Schifano's wife, and the only authorized official archive by sentences of the Italian judiciary.
Artistic style.
After returning from the USA, he rediscovers the techniques of the past with brilliant enamel, and rediscovers the figuration of the past, landscape and geometry, but the enamel is less juicy, the landscape, as the titles say, is an "anemic" landscape, but wants to contrast any impressionist interpretation
In Schifano's work we perceive the link between nature and technology, and the characterization of the materiality of color which gives the surface a highly elegant path and rhythm.
Mario Schifano was the most relevant exponent of the Italian art movement which, in the early 60s, anticipated the concepts of American Pop Art. "Schifano starts from the zeroing of the image to move on to a new figuration, thus focusing once again on the very meaning of painting. “I want to paint while painting” Schifano said in those days. Starting from his first monochromes, by resetting the degree of the pictorial gesture, he will turn towards the addition of enlarged images. Schifano transforms the canvas into a screen where he projects the images that are selected from his own memory. He isolates them, frames them, dilates them, imprints them on that film which has now become the surface of the picture. “This idea that the canvas is nothing but a support, a sort of place of memory, guides Schifano throughout his future journey".
Schifano passes to new pictorial images where he finds the representation of nature. Especially the latter is introduced in his "anemic landscapes" of 1963, where memory, through allusive phrases, rapid gestures and details, becomes the voice of the representation of nature itself. This will then further evolve in the series Trees, Oxygen Oxygen, Oasis, and imagination above all in the depiction of the Palm, where it finds its most complete maturity and where the artist carries forward his idea of ​​the painting and its function as a screen. It also alludes to the protection of the environment, in times when it was not lived like today, and it alludes to a human and cultural problem, representing the theme of escape, where to rediscover the soul. The escape from this solitude of the tree as an individual without roots, the escape from a way of building one's present through a rigid series of values, Schifano, in these paintings where the dream evidently begins to appear, the moment of detachment from reality, where the continuum of perspective space [...] tends to fracture, Schifano begins to analytically dissociate the image”&lt;ref&gt;AA.VV. , Mario Schifano, Parma, 1974/ref&gt;, it presents itself as a complete manifesto of his cultured art at a key moment.

= = = Sickness benefit = = =
Sickness benefit was part of the Social Security system in the United Kingdom. It started with the National Insurance Act 1911. People had to get a sick note and they had to have paid enough National Insurance Contributions. It lasted for six months. After that people got Invalidity Benefit if they were still ill. That was more money. 
After 1983 most people got Statutory Sick Pay from their work for the first 8 weeks they were ill instead of sickness benefit. From 1986 Statutory Sick Pay lasted for 28 weeks, so people didn't get sickness benefit unless they couldn't get Statutory Sick Pay. 
In 1948 it was 26 shillings a week, but married women only got 16 shillings because they were expected to rely on their husband for money. In 1987 it was £30.05 a week for both men and women.

Invalidity Benefit was a social security benefit from the United Kingdom's National Insurance scheme that was introduced in 1971 by Edward Heath's government. It was paid to people who were sick for more than six months. It was replaced by Incapacity Benefit in 1995.
In 1977 a special benefit was started for married women who had not paid National Insurance. It was called Housewives Non-contributory Invalidity Pension. They had to show that they could not do "normal household duties", like shopping, cooking and cleaning, for at least 28 weeks,

B:	Huh.
B:	Well, here in Seattle, uh, it's the air's getting more and more polluted.
B:	We're, uh, we're in kind of a basin
B:	And, uh, Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains.
B:	And, uh, there's been a lot, a lot of growth, population growth around here
B:	And, uh, it's, uh, it's getting worse
B:	I think  most of it is from cars.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Definitely.
A:	Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the, of these Rocky Mountains here, where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo
A:	and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north,
A:	we get a lot of pollution
A:	and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And, uh, it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion
A:	And when we get, get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
A:	and it just sits and sits and sits
A:	and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's not, it's almost sad.
A:	Because when I grew up here, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys
A:	and now it's not in the mountain valleys.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I live in the, university district
B:	and, uh, uh, it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution
B:	I think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school.
A:	Huh.
B:	And then we're right next to Interstate Five also.
A:	They're getting serious about things like, uh, mandatory,
A:	well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties,
A:	emissions.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	have they started doing that yet?
A:	Yeah.
A:	They've actually started doing it down along the,
A:	not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better.
A:	We have a lot, population is a lot lighter up here.
B:	We have that here
B:	and, uh, they're, they're expanding it to, uh, more counties here. Uh, as the population spreads out
B:	and I think they're also going to be making it, uh, mandatory for more cars.
B:	there was, uh, something in the law about if your car was over a certain age, like over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done anymore.
B:	And  I think they're eliminating that, uh  that loophole.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They're eliminating that out here.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're, uh, looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the, basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust.
A:	Kind of like a radar gun.
A:	And ...
B:	Oh, really,
B:	You mean they could  do that remotely?
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do it remotely just looking at the, what they do,
A:	they do several different types of things.
A:	Sometimes they put a source light
A:	and they look at the source light
A:	and then as the car goes by, you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it
A:	and you can look at the emissions actually.
B:	Huh.
A:	And ...
B:	Now where does the source light go?
A:	Like across the street.
A:	They'll set up  like a trap or something like that in some sense.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And they're also looking at, uh, other, you know, ways of monitoring this and, cause they've found out something basically that, uh,
A:	and a poorly tuned car can emit something,
A:	it's an incredible amount.
A:	It was like four hundred times as much uh, of certain pollutants, and it was like unburned hydrocarbons, then a properly tuned car.
B:	Jeez.
A:	And, and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars, well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the, the pollution then, you know, you, it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's neat
B:	But it's also been, uh, oh, you know,
B:	everybody is talking about using more mass transient here
B:	but it, uh, it's tough, you know.
B:	Like I've, I've looked into riding the bus to work
B:	and I can drive to work in, uh, and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But if I, uh, if I take the bus, it requires several transfers
B:	and it takes over an hour.
A:	Huh.
B:	So so it  it's, it's not hard to see why, why I keep driving.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they're ...
B:	And you know, I feel guilty cause I'm driving a
A:	Hi
B:	Hi.
A:	Uh, uh I, I should say something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That I'm the, uh, least informed,
A:	this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic.
A:	But, it's, I'm the least informed person in the whole United States.
A:	This has not been determined yet
A:	but I, I, I've never read a newspaper in my entire life
A:	and I've, I, I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off.
A:	But,
B:	Any particular reason?
A:	Well, no.
A:	I, I've, I've explored that with lots of people.
A:	Uh, they've tried to lock me up and, uh, things like that.
A:	But, uh, uh, I'm basically not interested
A:	and I also find the, uh, everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and and off the, uh, uh,
A:	what am I trying to say. Uh,
A:	I do learn about things. Largely from friends
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh
A:	and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS.
A:	You know, someone will write a book about something
A:	and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it,
A:	and somehow,
A:	and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so, uh, covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it.
A:	But, I mean, I don't think it's just that I'm lazy
B:	I really don't,
B:	I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon. Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest. But, assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. Uh, without thinking that there were people in, who think each other areas, area of, of specialty
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I guess you could explain it two ways.
B:	And, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all.
B:	And the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in buying something as a, you know  as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I think the same thing is true with news.
B:	If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on, most papers, and especially the better papers, the, the TIMES, the WALL STREET JOURNAL, the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know  that much.
A:	Right.
A:	Doesn't want,
A:	Let me ask, by the way, just for the record.
A:	I, I'm, I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them.
A:	So, I mean, I'm not being elitist in that sense, I hope. Uh,
B:	Well, I mean, there's, there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things
A:	Yeah.
A:	What,
B:	And most people think it is
B:	and I can, I can, you know, accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	By the way when you say most people think it is,
A:	I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is, percent.
B:	I don't think it's that high.
A:	Oh, you don't?
B:	I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper.
A:	Right.
B:	And I think they're saying well if something's really important, I'll at least find out that it happened.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and that's a, that's, is a reasonable start
B:	and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked.
B:	Uh, and if something important happened, it was covered on T V
B:	and I could then go and, and pick up newspapers if, if it were important enough to read about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I did, on the, uh, the Supreme Court hearings, the, for, uh, uh, the whole business of, uh,
A:	see I actually have a, a,
B:	Clarence Thomas or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	the Thomas and Anita Hill business.
B:	Right.
A:	I, I mean that's, that's the closest thing.
A:	I deeply cared about that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine
A:	and when I arrived at her house, she was engrossed in that.
A:	We ended up watching it for a couple of hours. Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more.
A:	And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on.
A:	But even then, I didn't end up doing it on my own. Uh, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I stayed as far away from those as I could.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I decided I didn't want to waste the time
B:	I had, I guess, five years ago now, wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings. And afterwards, decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in. And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you ever read,
A:	what sort of company do you work for?
A:	Do you work for a big or a little place?
B:	Uh, I work for Georgia Tech.
B:	Yes sir.
B:	I work for the research facility.
B:	Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense
B:	but it, it does have, about, uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small.
B:	It just have a lot of different laboratories.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's make up most of the laboratory
B:	so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about yourself?
A:	Huh.
A:	Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place.
A:	I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	I see.
A:	Uh, and, uh,
A:	so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T.
A:	So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh  the technical institution.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Right. Uh,
A:	Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't know.
A:	What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?
B:	Well those and probably the security aspect of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated,
B:	and it may not be true in every place.
B:	In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in.
B:	How they going to pay their bills.
B:	They just lay them off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh,
B:	I think the company still exists.
B:	What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like,
B:	unemployment is good
B:	but I mean the company as a whole
B:	because you as an employee, even the company is making money,
B:	they paying you a salary
B:	but you are responsible for that company growth.
B:	You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits.
B:	So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.
B:	I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation.
A:	Now how do you mean that?
A:	I know it,
B:	Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh, for the bad times of the company.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know. In that standpoint.
A:	Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company
A:	or,
B:	yes,
B:	I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really do.
B:	I think it'd be better that way
B:	and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because  they know that that there are problems
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know. That's just, that's my views, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that.
A:	I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile.
A:	They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	And I think you can do that for a little while
A:	but I'm,
B:	Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance
A:	Yeah.
A:	All right, have you lived in this area long?
B:	No,
B:	I've only been here a couple of years.
A:	Okay.
B:	Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain.
A:	I mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well I remember last year, or the year before, uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh,
A:	But it,
B:	terrible ice storm, uh, around this time of the year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny
B:	it, it's really quite, uh, quite amazing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	unseasonable.
A:	I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring,
A:	it was so much ice that came down, later on that that afternoon and evening,
B:	Um. Yes,
A:	it was just, it was horrible.
B:	I was just talking to my son today,
B:	he's up in Boston,
B:	and it was twenty-nine there
B:	and it was, you know, in the seventies out here
B:	and, it was really, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he really wished he could be here, rather than there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, um, I don't know
A:	I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather.
B:	Oh really.
A:	Um, I, I like it warmer,
A:	I mean I like it, you know, I like it warm
A:	but it doesn't really matter.
A:	I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
A:	but, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I have, you know,
B:	I, I,
B:	I think it's really been delightful.
B:	I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas
B:	and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all.
A:	Well I spent three years in Germany,
A:	so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
A:	But I got used to it,
A:	it was really strange,
A:	I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just swelter
A:	and then we got used to it
A:	and then we went up to Dallas
A:	and it was just,
A:	it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry,
A:	it's just not very comfortable,
A:	it just,
B:	do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a little bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You must, well, uh,
B:	it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister,
A:	we were, we were down there
A:	and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride with my sister
A:	and the air conditioning went out on the car
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,
B:	Oh yes.
A:	and this,
A:	it was just,
A:	the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus
A:	and it was just killing us.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	it's terrible.
B:	Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, that's really bad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or, you know,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	just, you know, so mild,
A:	and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat,
A:	you know you're sweating,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you look down at your arm,
A:	but you see the water leaving your arm,
A:	it's so hot, you just feel it pulling away, bizarre.
B:	Oh wow, uh.
B:	I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh it doesn't,
B:	some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons
B:	but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, it's kind of a luxury.
A:	I tend to agree
A:	but, I don't know,
A:	I, I think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten.
A:	No,
A:	the other topics.
A:	I got one topic,
A:	they said talk about the Middle East well,
B:	I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think about what
B:	my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.
B:	We messed up the conversation, anyway.
A:	Well I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty controversial topics
A:	so it's just like well that was my fault.
A:	But then the weather's like,
A:	man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane,
A:	I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	weather's just not all that inspiring.
B:	Okay,
B:	well it's nice talking to you.
A:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	pretty good,
B:	pretty good.
B:	So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *listen
A:	Drug testing in the work place.
A:	Um. I've been tested a few times, just before drug employment.
A:	But that's about it.
A:	I've never had random drug testing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have random drug testing at, in my business,
B:	but I've never been, uh, never had to do it.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they started that about a year ago,
B:	and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,
B:	at least that's.
A:	Oh, they do with alcohol.
B:	Pardon?
A:	They do it with alcohol?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they, they, they'll check for alcohol.
A:	Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
B:	No,
B:	once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing.
A:	Huh. That's interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a,
A:	What type of field of work are you in?
B:	I'm in the oil business.
A:	Oh, in the oil business.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	and you work in the office around.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I work in the office,
B:	so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags for the cars,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and we work around a lot of explosives.
B:	Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so that's, you know,
A:	I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,
A:	and so they could blow up the whole,
A:	well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,
A:	but still, it can be dangerous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, I, I, I agree.
B:	I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know,
B:	if it's,
B:	as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,
B:	as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.
A:	Now do they fire them, or do they?
B:	Well, see, this is it,
B:	this is where I start having my problems with my company.
B:	I work for a private company,
B:	and and the policy is something like, see if I can state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.
A:	Huh, that's.
A:	I think our policy is that,
A:	all right, it's probably the same thing.
A:	I'm not really sure what the
B:	Yeah,
B:	really,
B:	it's one of those things that you read once,
B:	and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it
A:	That's right.
A:	But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,
A:	but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
B:	I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.
A:	Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,
B:	Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment
B:	and, you know, it's not,
B:	I guess I haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, so I you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,
B:	I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A and B are going to be in
B:	and next week, C and D are going to come in
A:	You could time it just right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	right.
A:	I know one employee,
A:	I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,
A:	and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
A:	That'd be just as dangerous.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.
A:	Huh. That's true.
B:	You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do they give any limits on alcohol,
A:	or is it?
B:	Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
B:	I don't think they do.
B:	Um, well, they must,
B:	I mean, gee whiz.
B:	That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,
B:	because I, I really don't know.
B:	I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
A:	Oh.
B:	Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.
B:	Uh, there was a company in Houston that,
B:	they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of,
B:	it was not only drugs,
A:	Okay Karen.
A:	you're first.
B:	Okay.
B:	I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental.
A:	Okay.
B:	They're also important.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association
B:	Um.
A:	so there is a progressive path,
A:	but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh, like really,
B:	Um.
B:	Are they like pretty much train for a specific job
B:	and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	somewhat that,
A:	but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,
A:	uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.
A:	But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,
B:	Well, you know that's interesting though.
B:	Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.
B:	I use to think that, you know, after you work,
B:	you mean security, job security?
A:	Job security,
A:	yes.
B:	Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,
B:	but I don't know if it is so much anymore.
B:	In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, it wasn't necessarily,
B:	I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we are seeing that here as well.
A:	Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No doubt
A:	But,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,
A:	it's where it's most expedient which, Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's  often the lowest support type roles.
B:	Expedient,
B:	yeah
B:	that's exactly it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
B:	See, yeah.
A:	So we,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think that's one of the things too.
B:	You get too many management people, you know.
A:	It's very easy.
B:	Yeah
B:	and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.
B:	Well, those people aren't there anymore.
A:	Right.
A:	Because it's support people that are providing  the speed for it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but,
B:	so what else do you think is important?
A:	Well the, uh,
A:	that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because my perspective is from an institution,
A:	uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess innovation,
A:	although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly
A:	and so you can see the reward of the efforts.
B:	I think probably in a small,
B:	yeah,
B:	I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing.
B:	You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.
A:	Right.
B:	Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You end up being your own person
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem
A:	and you know you really,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	whereas yeah in a smaller,
B:	I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Hi.
A:	Okay.
A:	So, uh, with the issue of trial by jury, uh, I actually found the whole question about whether you need a, a a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually, I, I agree that that's an interesting thing.
B:	I, I believe that's a, for, for civil suits it's not unanimous, right,
B:	but for, for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law?
A:	I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where, uh, I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I actually thought I'd read that, too
B:	and that's why I phrased it that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wonder,
B:	the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,
B:	and things that are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,
B:	but I don't know what the, the laws,
B:	do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous?
A:	Well, I'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is.
A:	And I, I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.
A:	But I don't know whether you need an, a unanimous, uh, vote of not guilty to acquit.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that would be an interesting change.
B:	It was also allow the, uh, idea that if you had one person who was, uh, very disagreeable that, I mean, it, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because, uh, the fact that it's the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, uh, criterion that it, uh, increases the, the likelihood of getting the proper judgment.
B:	So, I, I think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'd agree with that.
A:	But I've never had the, the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, I guess, about five years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually I, I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do.
A:	But,
B:	I would like to do that.
B:	I've been out here twenty some years
B:	and I've been called, uh, three different times,
B:	but I've never actually even made it into the, the jury box. And, because there have always been a number of people
A:	Oh.
B:	and, and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions.
B:	Uh, I,
B:	yeah,
B:	I also think that would be really good.
B:	I,
A:	the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.
B:	Well, the, the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's, an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that that, uh, peer pressure,
B:	and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'd read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at what had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations.
B:	Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I understand.
B:	You, you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, uh, to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response.
B:	I think of the movie, uh, TWELVE ANGRY MEN.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You ever seen that movie?
A:	Yeah,
A:	once.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	it's, it's, it's exactly that situation where, uh,
B:	it's Henry Fonda
B:	and it's eleven to one
B:	and he's the one,
B:	I, I believe he was opposed to the conviction
B:	and, uh, and he held on
B:	and,
A:	Hi.
A:	So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?
B:	Uh, actually no,
B:	because, because I'm in school.
B:	I, I kind of miss out on most of the current events.
B:	I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it.
A:	Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?
B:	Uh, I don't watch a lot of it,
B:	but that's the
B:	basically that's my only major source of information.
A:	Um.
B:	What about, what about you?
A:	Well, I read, uh,
A:	I get a bunch of different things.
A:	I get a newspaper every day
A:	and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that
A:	and I look through, uh,
A:	I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much read that cover to cover
A:	and I, as far as, you know,
A:	that satisfies most of the short term news I get.
A:	Uh, don't watch much T V,
A:	don't have enough time
A:	and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,
A:	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's about all I ever hear of it.
A:	Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK
A:	and for the longer term I, I read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they,
A:	the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news,
A:	but it's recent material.
B:	And it's more in depth.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is, it is more in depth, less broad.
A:	Well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,
A:	but it's just more in depth
A:	and, uh, it is, it is more it is more just significant information, you know.
A:	It is the big events, not the little events.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know.
B:	I know,
B:	where they're just trying to fill in.
A:	Yes,
A:	or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow
B:	I know,
B:	I do, I do, too.
A:	and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like oh, so exciting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you may find one little, uh, news item interesting
B:	so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's about what it ends up being.
A:	Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually, you mention NEWSWEEK,
B:	I, I, I do like, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.
B:	I don't get to read it as much as I like,
B:	but that's, I think that's a good magazine.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think they're about the same.
A:	I, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.
A:	And, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you,
A:	I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring?
B:	Well right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit.
A:	I think it will,
A:	uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence,
A:	but we've yet to see it
A:	and
A:	it's real short term yet, though,
A:	I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they like to tell us that it's going to be important
B:	I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting
A:	I think it is, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I think that's a possibility,
A:	uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	definitely.
A:	For the companies that already have a presence over there
A:	and, uh, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time.
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	so they have a toe hold,
B:	I good toe hold.
A:	Yep.
A:	Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand.
A:	But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist
B:	so,
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,
A:	even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like, England doesn't want to do one thing
A:	and, and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing
A:	and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And some of it, I mean, is,
A:	I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I can understand their viewpoint,
B:	they're just, they're starting off,
B:	their economy's a little bit weak,
B:	so you want to get established before they
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Before they open up their borders to everyone.
B:	Yeah,
B:	totally.
A:	Uh, what is the, uh,
A:	do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that?
B:	Actually I'm not really into sports.
B:	My roommates are,
B:	so, unfortunately, I forced to watch quite a bit of sports.
A:	Against your will.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have to, fight over the remote control.
A:	Yeah,
A:	at least you guys have a remote control.
A:	It's sometimes better to not have one of those.
A:	Course, you can always mislocate it. Or misplace it, I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it
A:	and,
A:	So, what kind of music you into?
B:	Well, I have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music.
B:	In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that I don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.
A:	The opera, yeah, it's right on track.
A:	I like classical,
A:	but I can't deal with opera at all.
A:	And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy.
A:	I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's, it's got to have a point to it.
B:	Oh, I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,
B:	but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you, is, uh, gets a little annoying.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What kind of progressive stuff?
B:	Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know,
B:	I'm thirty,
B:	so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and R E M, that sort of stuff.
A:	uh.
B:	Uh, R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point,
B:	and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, a lot of people like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's pretty much, you know, bull.
A:	Because R E M really hasn't changed.
A:	If, it's, it's interesting.
A:	They're producing, uh, similar music
A:	and it's good music
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, you know, people have picked up on it.
A:	That's good.
B:	I think it is.
A:	I'm impressed.
B:	Uh, for a while there, music seemed to really popular music seemed to have, uh, not a lot of point to it.
B:	I was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton.
B:	Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he, he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And I could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.
A:	Uh, but he picked the right songs
A:	and and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter.
B:	I guess.
B:	That, and a marvelous hairdo.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm sure that, that that sold a lot for him.
A:	That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop.
A:	I'm I've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop.
A:	It just seems like there's no, no real point.
A:	You hear the same, same tune over and over again in a thousand guises
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Well, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like a lot of classical music,
B:	but I also dislike, uh, some classical music,
B:	and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music, and feel that if, if it's not seventy five years old, it hasn't stood the test of time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can, I can believe that.
A:	What kind of things are you, do you like in classical?
A:	What's the standard?
B:	Uh,
B:	Stuff that I like,
B:	uh, I like Bach.
B:	I tolerate Vivaldi.
B:	I can't, stand, uh, uh, Debussy or Debussy different
B:	Uh, uh, I like Tchaikovsky.
B:	He can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	Uh, and some of, some stuff that I like, uh,
B:	for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's interesting music,
B:	but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic, uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive.
B:	You know, we're, we're, much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth,
B:	that's right, you know,
B:	we'll do, we'll do the ninth
B:	and everyone will know it and and hum it
A:	It's safe.
B:	and it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me.
B:	Uh, I feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,
A:	Do you think that there's any way that, uh,
A:	or do you think there's too much crime now?
A:	I mean, I guess, any crime is too much
A:	but, It's out of control.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, well, uh, out of control, I don't know.
B:	I guess it could be worse.
B:	Uh, we've, uh, we've, we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood.
B:	Uh, I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington.
B:	Uh, there's, uh, there's a lot of problems.
B:	I mean, there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people
B:	and, uh, you know, we get cars on our block, uh, regularly, uh, uh, uh, gone through, rifled through and stuff.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would not of, okay, I would not have guessed that in Seattle.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you figured it was like Omaha, right?
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
B:	No,
B:	it's, uh, it's not Newark,
B:	but, uh, yeah
B:	it's got problems.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I wonder, I mean, I wonder what, what really is the answer.
A:	I mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room
A:	and we, we try to put aside in the warehouse,
A:	and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	That's what I hear.
A:	So it's, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think, you know,
B:	don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea?
A:	I get the feeling that a lot of people have.
A:	I'm not convinced that I have.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, see, I mean, my mom taught English as a second language
A:	and, and she was dealing mostly with people that were, were in on drug crimes
A:	and, uh,
B:	Oh, you mean she taught in a prison?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh.
A:	In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia.
B:	I see.
B:	uh.
A:	And, the problem she had was not with the inmates at all.
A:	The, the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison.
A:	I mean, It was, it was, I mean,
B:	Yeah,
B:	the the bureaucracy.
A:	they, they put her, I mean,
A:	I didn't, obviously I didn't see the classroom, uh, and, hopefully never will,
A:	but, uh they, they put her at the end of a hallway,
A:	there were no other classes going on at the time
A:	and they refused to let her wear a body a body alarm. Which,
B:	Uh.
A:	and
A:	I don't know exactly what that is,
A:	but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and, and really annoy a lot of people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, you know
B:	So she didn't feel safe.
A:	No,
A:	she didn't.
A:	She didn't,
A:	she, she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates,
A:	and then later on the, uh, the administration kept getting worse,
A:	and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the States, she decided that it was too,
A:	she didn't feel that public schools were were safe,
A:	so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Well, at least it's maximum security, right
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, but the point that was, that it, you know,
A:	you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible
A:	and, and I'm, I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that run the system have given up on it.
B:	Uh, well, I, I think the people that run, yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.
A:	Uh.
B:	I mean, I, uh, you know, I, I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff
B:	and it's, uh,
B:	you can get pretty hardened, I'm sure.
A:	But getting, I mean, well, see,
A:	I always have problems because, because I can never decide whether or not I'm, I'm supposed to be a conservative or, or a liberal
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	But I keep, I keep thinking that there's got to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances.
B:	Those are funny see
A:	I mean, I can't help but wonder if, if I grew up without a father, on the streets, and with like little or no money, wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison this
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, Oh, yeah,
B:	absolutely.
B:	I think, uh, yeah, I think you can blame it on social problems.
B:	Sure.
A:	I mean, I don't know.
B:	I mean, as, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's been more crime.
A:	We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't  get onto the program.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's not enough  beds and treatment programs, rising drug abuse,
B:	and, yep,
B:	it's a mess.
A:	I don't, I don't remember the, the gentleman's name,
A:	but the, the, uh, the mayor of Baltimore is a, is a Rhodes Scholar
A:	and what he,
B:	Is he the guy wants to, like, deregulate heroin, or something?
A:	Well, what he wants to do is take all the money that, uh, he gets for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Stop trying to attack supply because, which, which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't.
A:	I mean, Switzerland tried the, the grand experiment
A:	and, you know, they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
A:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	Jonathan, uh, you you say it's near and dear to your heart.
A:	Buying a car is, uh, something you're contemplating, I take it.
B:	Uh, fantasizing about.
A:	Uh.
B:	Can't do it right now.
B:	Our situation is that we're a two car family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago.
A:	Uh
B:	It's got a, uh, five year loan,
B:	so that's still got a couple years to run
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the car I get to drive is a, uh, Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month
B:	so, I think about, uh, sprucing that up in a couple years if I can.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you think you'll, uh, what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?
B:	Well since I just turned forty, I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need to take the kids to school, probably have to have something that, uh, wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. *spelling wined should be wind
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	a seating room.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I think the next car we get will probably be a well
A:	I, I like Buicks.
A:	We have a Buick Century now,
A:	it's a nineteen eighty-seven
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, whatever I get, I want to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down to get over,
A:	so I think the four door is probably a major requirement
B:	Sure.
A:	and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car.
A:	Uh, you know, I'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh
B:	Sure.
A:	something that will carry it around careful, I guess is best, best way to describe it.
A:	Right now, we've got a V six
A:	and it, that seems to be just fine.
A:	I know they they're coming out with some V eight now
A:	and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back,
B:	so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, V eights seem to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.
A:	Right.
A:	I, uh, I drive a, a truck, a Ford truck.
A:	I, I like trucks because they're spacious,
A:	and it's handy to haul things.
A:	Uh, it's not related to my business,
A:	I just really use it, basically, for transportation,
A:	but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that,
A:	and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one.
B:	Sure.
B:	Is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there.
A:	Traction?
A:	Uh, not really, uh, you know,
A:	it's a two wheel drive truck
A:	and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home anyway
B:	Actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it,
B:	yeah.
B:	We, uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago.
A:	Wow.
B:	A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm
B:	and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,
B:	and, this is a rear wheel drive model.
B:	So, we got some monster studded snow tires after that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Haven't had any problems since.
A:	What kind of, what make is the mini van?
B:	It's a Mazda.
A:	Mazda,
A:	I see.
B:	And, uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, uh, driveability.
B:	Fuel economy isn't great, being a mini van,
B:	but, uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others
B:	and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around
A:	Right.
B:	so we've been able to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when called upon.
A:	One of my sons has a, a Plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the Voyager, I guess
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, they have a, a child that's five years old
A:	and it's really handy for hauling him around and, and their stuff,
A:	and, of course, as he gets friends, I'm sure that will be even handier.
A:	So, I know if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that we're going to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years to come.
B:	Probably till the kids are out of, uh, high school anyway.
A:	What about, uh, all wheel drive?
A:	Is that something that you'd be interested in
A:	or is that,
B:	Uh I'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And even as, as light as that is with, uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, I probably don't want to be driving anyway.
A:	Right.
B:	So I know I'd be happy with a, a reasonable, uh, four door.
B:	You know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with getting kids into the,
A:	What kind of crime do you think, uh, is the most prevalent in our society?
B:	Oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.
A:	Such as New York City
B:	Is that what happens up there a lot?
B:	Uh, that, that's mostly what I hear, is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen.
B:	That's the most prevalent crime. Uh, the ones that really, you know, the ones that really add up after a while, I guess, you know, from, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.
B:	You know, everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, I mean, so many people use it,
A:	and even though just using is not really,
A:	I mean it is a crime,
B:	Oh, well, yeah,
B:	that, that, that is a crime.
B:	I guess, uh, when you, when you count all the little things that people do like,
B:	uh, speeding is a crime
A:	Well, that's true.
B:	I break that law every day
A:	But I was, I, I was staying in the realm of, of felonies versus misdemeanors and, uh, drug use,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,
A:	but, uh, what kind, what kind,
A:	have you been, uh, have you been the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything?
B:	Well, I've, uh, I've been caught with marijuana before,
B:	so I guess that was a crime.
B:	I got a year's probation for that,
B:	but, uh,
A:	That, that's not that much.
A:	I mean  you know, those aren't,
B:	No,
B:	it wasn't that  big a deal.
A:	I,
B:	Uh, when I think of crime, I think of stuff that, that affects other people like people getting, you know, killed or raped.
B:	I think rape is one of the worst crimes
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it is.
A:	I, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's very degrading
A:	Uh,
A:	Murder, murder is, is hard on the people that were related to
A:	you know, I mean, it is a rather final solution,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	once, once a person's, you know, gone, then it's,
B:	but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life, you know.
A:	Yes.
A:	What, what do you think is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder or something like that.
B:	Well for, for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death penalty is,
B:	it's a pretty good thing.
A:	I agree with that.
B:	They, they have that down here in Florida still.
B:	They the electric chair
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think Virginia does, too, up here.
B:	Oh, do they?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think, I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy
B:	and, I guess usually they're, they're always sure they got the right guy,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think the appeal process takes too long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so do I.
A:	I think, I, I think it should take, from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year.
B:	Yeah,
B:	if that.
B:	You know, the sooner,
B:	a, a, a year's plenty of time you know, for something to come out, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then, you know, there's been guys in jail for six years
B:	and the other guy admits that he did it
B:	and they
B:	it's like oops,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I mean, the system isn't perfect,
A:	I mean, it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans.
A:	You do the best you can to make it perfect, you know,
A:	you, you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect.
B:	Right.
A:	But, I think you have to accept some of the errors.
A:	I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if, if there was a credible punishment, uh, for murderers.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	I don't know if it would or not though.
B:	I, I don't think it's a, so much of a deterrent as, as it is a, a good, uh, a good way for vengeance, you know, for the relatives and, and family members,
B:	you know what I mean?
A:	And society probably, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, just general society to,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it kind of gets it off their chest.
A:	Uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it does
A:	and, and it decreases the prison population. And, which is significant
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know that a, a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other.
A:	I mean, Yeah.
B:	And they're the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.
B:	I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead,
B:	but, I, you might be able to, uh, stop people, you know,
B:	they're thinking about it,
B:	they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught.
A:	Yeah,
A:	generally the crimes of passion and things like that, uh, are not premeditated.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, they can be,
A:	but usually they aren't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're spur of the moment
B:	That's right.
A:	and, uh, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and plans, when you catch those, those individuals, I think that you, you end up with a, uh, uh, how do I want to, you end up with a you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they could probably do it again.
A:	Yes,
A:	they, they would have no problems doing it again.
B:	That's right,
B:	they didn't have any time doing it the first time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because as a, as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay, you know, one and a,
B:	No,
B:	it
B:	Okay.
B:	Thanks.
A:	Huh.
A:	Do you all have a budget?
B:	Well, uh, yeah,
B:	we, we do.
B:	Um, we've been married for twenty-three years
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have, uh, three teenage daughters
B:	and, you know, they're very expensive.
B:	So, uh, uh, we, yeah, we have somewhat of, uh, a system.
B:	Uh, it's, it's kind of, uh, you know, it's kind of hard to explain.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We've actually gone, uh, just recently, to you know having, having two checking accounts.
B:	We always had just one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And now we are having two.
B:	Uh, it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	So, I have to be.
B:	That's that's kind of the way I feel about it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I usually, uh,
A:	my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances
A:	and of course, we're like like a lot of people.
A:	We just scramble through month to month, you know.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Do you have a two income family or one income?
A:	Uh, we have a two income uh family.
B:	Yeah.
A:	She also works
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, but she, she enjoys it
A:	and she's good at it.
A:	Uh, if it's, if it's,
A:	I am kind of, uh, uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and one of these days I am going to do something about that
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know how that goes,
A:	but, uh, uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well.
A:	She, uh she writes all the checks, you know, once a month.
B:	So your wife,
B:	Yes.
B:	It
B:	that
B:	what
B:	her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or accounting?
A:	Uh, sort of on a peripheral.
A:	She's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator
B:	Oh.
A:	and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, but she enjoys it.
A:	She likes keeping track of all that stuff
A:	and, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that's sort of related to her field a little bit.
A:	Yeah
A:	sort of.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we, you know, we've experimented with, with, uh, budgets, you know from time to time, uh,
A:	but, if, you know,
A:	you have to keep up with them.
A:	So a lot of times, we just, uh, just kind of play it by ear.
A:	We try to keep our, uh, our retirement and our savings kind of automated
B:	Yeah.
A:	so we never see that money.
A:	Just like taken directly.
B:	It's just taking it out, right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We do the same thing.
A:	And that, that's kind of handy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because if you don't see it, you don't miss it
B:	Yeah,
B:	if
A:	You don't spend it.
B:	you have something to take it out.
B:	That's exactly what we've always done
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we've had, uh, they've always had, uh, where they match your funds, you know,
B:	sometimes if you, if you save so much, then they will match it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that, you know, we've done that too.
B:	But, my husband works for an insurance company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess.
B:	But he was with another company before that,
B:	but we have, we have,
B:	I, I work also,
B:	but I only have a part time job
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I get paid very little
B:	but, uh, you know, I try to use that money for food
B:	Jim gives me a certain amount money.
B:	You know, we just transfer it into my account
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I use that for food, household expenses,
B:	and then I add my own check to that
B:	and then with that I try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but the expenses that we need and have around the house.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It  sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.
B:	So.
A:	Just kind of play it by ear, but keep the, the deductions  you know
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we
B:	well Jim has, Jim has a budget.
B:	I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, you know. I am given so much money a month,
B:	so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I try not to, you know,
B:	we don't, you know, I don't ask for more.
B:	I mean I just try and make it on that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
B:	Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you can, you can really waste a lot of money that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, well how long have you been married?
A:	Uh, about five years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So you're just really getting started
B:	So do you have a family too?
A:	Uh, I've got one little girl.
A:	She's like, uh, nineteen months.
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, she's, she's not, uh,
B:	She hasn't effected your budget yet really.
A:	Not, not really.
A:	Not too bad. Uh.
B:	No.
B:	Not like she will later on.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You will see that  all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
A:	Yeah
A:	when,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	what can we do here
B:	and then you have to really sit down and plan some more
B:	and, uh, but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and more of that.
B:	You know, more budgeting as as they got older.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but uh, but what do you do?
B:	Do you,
A:	I'm uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I work at a, for a university. Uh, Georgia Tech, uh, research
B:	Oh.
B:	Well good.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Good.
A:	So I just, uh,
B:	Well, we just have, you know, we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta.
B:	I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things.
B:	I'd better get back to the subject.
A:	Oh, well
B:	But, uh, budgeting.
B:	I found, you know, I feel a lot better.
B:	You know, we use to work out of one check book
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending
B:	and it's so much easier,
B:	Uh, well, having
B:	of the reason going through the school system
B:	I seem to be younger than most people who, who talk on this thing.
B:	I'm, I'm just graduating graduating from college.
B:	Uh, I didn't really perceive much of a, of a problem with the school system.
B:	However, when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and
B:	you can compare just about thing to Japan
B:	need to separate every th and we look like we don't have anything.
B:	Uh, it seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough.
B:	Uh, however, I, if it weren't for our needless, uh, competition with Japan, I, I'd, I'd think that, that, the school systems, system works at a pretty good pace.
A:	I don't know.
A:	Uh, I haven't,
A:	it's been, uh, well seventy-nine since I was at school. At high school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I've seen things change.
A:	I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually,
A:	because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then
A:	so it's hard to compare.
A:	You know what I mean?
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, it seems like when I I lived in Chicago,
A:	I, I've lived down here.
A:	I hear the dropout rates from the schools,
A:	and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth.
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean, I, I've seen so many different things. So, so many different bad reports coming out of the school system
A:	and I recognize that there are good schools out there.
A:	I mean, somebody's  getting, getting a good education because we, continue to employ people.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, I don't, I don't understand the, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities.
B:	Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either.
B:	Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools.
B:	But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas,
B:	it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime.
B:	And they all seem to go together.
B:	And it seems like if you could eliminate one of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better.
B:	So, uh, the other two
B:	they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix
B:	but it's just like, I, I don't expect them to know which, which, which part is best to fix just like I don't know.
B:	It's, it's a complicated issue.
B:	I, I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.
A:	I don't know if I blame it on the school.
A:	I think, I think I blame it, I think I blame it on a couple of different things.
A:	I think I blame it on the school system. Uh,
B:	Well, that's I meant when I said the school.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't blame it on the teachers in the school.
A:	I, although I think that,
A:	I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than,
A:	well, they do quite well for themselves
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid.
A:	No.
A:	Not all school districts are well paid.
A:	But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid.
A:	I mean I know one family that's got,
A:	they're both teachers,
A:	and they both have, like second jobs that they work in the afternoons.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They both work all summer full-time.
A:	And from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it, it,
A:	I mean that family is making over a hundred grand.
A:	And I'm,
A:	I mean, okay,
A:	okay.
A:	Yes,
A:	I agree that teaching our kids is important.
B:	Right.
A:	However, these people who only work eight hours day at it, from seven to three,
A:	and they only work nine months a year
A:	and they get an awful lot of breaks in between
A:	and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that.
A:	And I don't even have kids
B:	Yeah,
B:	well that's true.
B:	But there's,
B:	you can always play games with, uh, talking about, whoa, look at this.
B:	My tax dollars are paying for this.
B:	This is wrong.
B:	But, when you're
B:	and there's really not much you can directly do about that.
B:	I think that, that if, if there is a problem with the school system, uh, from, it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, uh, paid. That perhaps that might be one area that, that could be improved.
B:	Uh,
B:	you have other professional jobs
B:	and this is a profession.
B:	And, as a matter of fact, it's a pretty big influence on, on
A:	So, do you, your privacy being invaded at any time?
B:	Well, uh, one of the things that, uh, that I found to be, uh, an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the, on the, uh, credit card bill.
B:	That  is something that is not required
A:	Well,
A:	Right.
B:	and, in fact, uh, it is actually prohibited
B:	but it doesn't stop many people many people from, uh, from doing it.
B:	And it's one of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, uh, research.
B:	And to get your, your phone number on, uh, uh, lists for phone solicitations.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now that you can still, yeah,
A:	I've always done that.
A:	I started,
A:	once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse
A:	and I say what are you going to do.
A:	You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then  that's fine.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all.
A:	And then, ultimately, they say, no
A:	you don't have to put it down
A:	But, uh, really it's part of this compliance thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, the thing I don't like,
A:	I know that certain states actually sell their, uh, their lists like, uh, motor vehicles.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That really burns me because, hey, you're required.
A:	You have to do that.
B:	Right.
A:	And nowhere does it say you asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that, it, it's one thing to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks.
A:	You can always refuse
A:	but it's another thing where it's required by law
A:	and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody.  You know,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh, That,
A:	I don't think, I don't think they have the right to do that.
B:	I agree with you there.
B:	That's something that, uh, people have seen.
B:	Oh, here's an easy way to make some money.
B:	But, uh, I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not.
B:	I, I've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state.
B:	Uh, the budget problems up here are, are pretty tense.
B:	And people are looking for alternate ways of, uh,
B:	enhancing revenue is the, uh, phrase they use.
B:	And they were talking about selling the D M V lists
B:	and there was a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, consternation about that
B:	and the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea.
B:	But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, uh, public that you, don't know about.
A:	Well, that's easy.
A:	Whenever you donate money to someone?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They, you become, put on something like a sucker list
A:	and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations.
B:	Right.
A:	And then you
A:	it kind of makes you feel from doing it again.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like, uh, National Public Radio or any of these, the public, uh, stations, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I, I, I think I sent in, in money for, once to, uh, to public, uh, T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine.
B:	Huh.
A:	I,
A:	it's like
A:	and it just started soon after I had done that one.
B:	Right.
A:	And I just said this is, this is terrible
A:	Uh, and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it's one thing,
A:	they don't sell the list.
A:	But the thing that makes me mad is, uh, then they start getting, uh, other people,
A:	the people do these phonathons
B:	Right.
A:	and they call you up
A:	and they actually happen to be people who are, graduated in your class or something like that.
A:	And, and they say, oh, we, we know you.
A:	You, uh, had, uh, contributed x amount last year.
A:	Can you do better this year?
A:	And, you know, like hold on here.
B:	How do you know that?
A:	Who, how do you know that?
A:	Why, why you even telling me this?
A:	Is it any of your business?
A:	I mean, it's one thing that I, and the college knows that
A:	that's, just our business.
A:	There's no need for someone  who is soliciting should know at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just, uh,
A:	and that was very offensive too.
A:	I,
A:	and so very
B:	Last year, the, uh, Lotus Development Company, the, uh company that puts out One, Two, Three was planning on marketing a, uh, C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right
B:	One way or another we're now recording.
A:	Okay.
B:	Um, um, oh, yeah.
B:	Home repair.
A:	You were helping your parents.
B:	Right.
B:	I still am really.
B:	They're, uh, like some sort of sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta, in Candler Park.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we've done lots to it.
B:	We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them.
B:	And,
A:	So you're remodeling?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I, I just live in a, I live in an apartment now.
A:	I, uh, two summers ago I went to Massachusetts
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I went with a friend of mine
A:	and we undertook a building house.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And this was a, a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions
A:	and it's preconstructed you might say.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And we started in, uh, we, started from an empty lot with, uh, trees and stuff on it
A:	and we had to cut them, uh, down and clear the lot.
A:	We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and, uh, went from the ground up.
B:	Wow.
A:	Our  one of our main problems was,
B:	Wow.
A:	well in Massachusetts, I thought I was going to,
A:	well, it was a, a fun time
A:	but  I thought, gosh, summer time, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, all it ever did was rain and thunder storms
A:	And one thing is that we're, we had, we were going to pour the basement foundation.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we're in the process
A:	and it started pouring down rain.
B:	Huh.
A:	And I guess we had most of it done
A:	but the end was result,
A:	what happened was that some of the, the a lot of water settled on the top
A:	and it really didn't give a very good finish
A:	and some of the,
A:	it was sort of sandy and  and not, uh, a very good finish.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it turned, it was okay
A:	and it's only the basement floor
A:	so it was okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, it kept us pretty busy.
A:	It was only, uh,
A:	there was, well me and my friend
A:	and then we just had like two helpers and  uh, sort of a, a family type,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it wasn't, you know, like a commercial project or something.
A:	It was sort of just, you know, uh, gets your, get his, you know, my my brother and well, maybe, you know, my cousin's coming over today to help us do that  kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow.
A:	And, and then materials coming in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we're, we're hopping around pretty good.
A:	But overall, yeah, we got it done
A:	and it's a three bedroom, two bath house
A:	and it's pretty neat.
B:	Nice.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Nice.
B:	So, uh, I mean what was it for?
B:	You just,
A:	Well, it was, uh, for my friend's parents.
A:	They had some property there
A:	and they'd lived in this, this old,
A:	it's sort of like a farm, you might say.
A:	And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And his mom just wanted a, a new house. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that has been her dream.
A:	And so, we did that.
A:	And, uh, she was really pleased with it.
A:	So it came  really great
B:	That's great.
A:	so.
B:	Wow.
A:	So what, why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot.
B:	Huh?
A:	Where you live it gets very hot?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does.
A:	And that's why you,
A:	and the windows have you, what type of windows are you putting in?
B:	Huh.
A:	Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in, uh, you know, the solar game?
B:	Right.
A:	Have you,
A:	what, what, are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or,
B:	No.
B:	We just, we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass.
B:	My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	And, uh, but it,
B:	see in a lot of the windows?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's, the house is eighty years old
B:	and it's had several owners and stuff
B:	and, uh  they have put plastic, Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows.
A:	Okay.
A:	Oh, these
A:	so you have the sash windows in?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Did uh, did it go up and down?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And so, uh, and, and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Yes,
A:	there's a problem with those.
A:	Those are, uh,
A:	they usually most of the time don't open very well
B:	Yeah.
B:	Ours didn't
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the ones that would open, uh, wouldn't want to stay open
B:	They wanted  to slam shut.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they also, there, they, they,
A:	a lot of vibration
A:	and it causes the glass to crack
A:	and it's  a never ending problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. So I haven't, uh, I haven't been in any really home repair things lately.
A:	I,
A:	Uh, being a former drug user I, uh, I, I guess I have to say at this point, that I do approve of it.
B:	Whoa.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, because I know that, uh, in using drugs I was not a good employee.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there, uh,
A:	whenever you are an employee of the company, you are using its assets,
A:	and, uh, you are also under their liability, under the Workmen's Comp.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases
B:	Where do you work?
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, it's also a retreading plant,
A:	and that's where most of our, uh, injuries occur.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an, if a, a break or a man, uh, has an accident.
A:	Then he's automatically, uh, given a drug test.
B:	Right.
B:	Do they do it, like, you know, within hours of the accident,
B:	or is it?
A:	Yes,
A:	when he goes to the doctor the first time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so, that kind of, uh,
A:	I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started using it oh, for the past year or so.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now we've let some people go, uh, that we, was found that drugs were used in their system.
A:	Now, I don't know how T E C would handle it.
A:	They haven't pursued it, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, if there's some, uh, problem I know,
A:	there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,
A:	and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they showed it negative.
B:	Huh.
A:	So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's probably true, too.
B:	That's, that's, that's sort of scary.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	really.
A:	And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And he tested positive on cocaine.
A:	Now then you always wonder, well is he just saying that
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	really,
B:	really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's a bad situation.
B:	I think that probably, I think most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think they should.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm a T I employee
B:	and and, and, uh, I'm, I'm really gung ho for it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In fact I, you know,
B:	some of the places now, um, like I B M don't allow them smoking, you know in, in the plant.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	We, we have designated smoking areas.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, I work in sort of a building that's, that's not really, well
B:	it's on the campus of the T I facility,
B:	but it's a little bit, you know, separated.
B:	We lease the building.
B:	And it's, it's a factory environment.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they, they have designated smoking,
B:	but it's just wide open,
B:	it's not ventilated properly
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that's bad.
B:	But as far as the drugs, you know, being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's a, it's a definite, I think it's essential.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I, I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came, come up, you know,
B:	they never, they never called me,
B:	they never, you know,
B:	and finally, the day we declared war was my time
A:	You're kidding
B:	No
B:	And so, and, and my boss has, has gone for about like three times, I think.
B:	And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group
A:	The executives, right?
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	and of course, you know, they did being moved around and making specifically single them out when we started, you know, that they were going to do all them first.
A:	The executives?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Wouldn't that be awful if you were  if you were using, and, and oh, lose your job and everything.
B:	Which I thought was interesting
B:	Oh, man,
B:	yeah.
B:	Ooh, yeah.
A:	I can't believe I was so brazen before.
A:	I, like I say, I'm a former drug user,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I, I, well, I, I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior,
A:	and so I don't use drugs any more.
B:	Oh, what kind of drugs did you use, if you don't mind?
A:	Uh, marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines.
B:	Wow!
A:	Um, yes,
A:	uh-huh
A:	And all on the job, too.
B:	Really?
A:	You know, it had gotten that bad.
B:	Well, it's really lucky that you got away from that.
A:	Really,
B:	Cause that's really,  downward spiral.
A:	it's, it's
A:	life is so much more enjoyable.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's it.
A:	I mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Just life in general.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, well I'm definitely for it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Plus, you know, you, you want to think that, that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share, but that are not endangering your life,
A:	That's right.
B:	in some cases
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	like, uh, my husband, uh, several years back, worked for Motorola.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they had, you know,
B:	I mean it was a chemical handling type.
A:	Oh, goodness.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	And that's really, that's really frightening.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I think some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like, like I am.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	I would think there would be.
B:	Well, well you'd think so
B:	but, uh,
A:	But they weren't?
B:	I don't know if they do it till yet.
A:	Isn't that awful.
B:	Because when he was at,
B:	course now it's been years now, because it was before, it was even before they had the, the designated smoking  type stuff, you know, at T I.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I forgot what,
B:	I guess it was like eighty-four, eighty-five something like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they, at that time, they had no testing whatsoever.
A:	Huh.
B:	So that's scary
A:	Yeah.
A:	That reminds me of, uh,
A:	I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time,
A:	and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living.
A:	And she said, Oh, he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill, you know  where they go and dump all this toxic stuff.
B:	Oh, Lord.
B:	Oh.
A:	And I just, you know, went, Oh, where?
B:	Yeah,
B:	should we move?
A:	Let me move as far away as possible.
B:	Ooh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	That's awful.
A:	But, I'm proud, though, that, that, um, you know, I grew up in the sixties,
A:	and back then it was popular you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but people have really wizened, you know, become wise about drugs
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they really have a good campaign for the young people, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They know it's not smart,
A:	so. So, I guess it was just a generational thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	peer group is the other way now instead of,
A:	That's right,
A:	and that's good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's,
A:	That's the best way to stop it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, it really is.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I think we did it.
B:	Okay.
A:	So it's good talking to you.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you, Cathy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	bye-bye
A:	Okay,
A:	are you on any kind of, uh, regular exercise plan?
B:	I, I, yeah, I'm, yeah, I, I do aerobics, uh, step classes and, uh,  toning classes,
A:	Step classes?
B:	yes.
A:	What's that?
B:	It's, uh, it's a new, uh, form I think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established that early on then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that.
A:	Absolutely.
B:	Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried to do the DART.
B:	And, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that are out here in, in, uh, north Dallas as opposed to downtown,
B:	uh, to try to, to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area. You know, like New York does,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.
B:	Yeah.
A:	New York
A:	and some,  people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Someone made the analogy, uh, with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse.
A:	An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street.
A:	Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I drive to work every day by myself, uh, without even, even any thought of car pooling.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	And, uh, most people are that way. Because they're used to not having public transportation.
B:	Yep.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, but I,  here again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt. So and doing all these studies and the things
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.
A:	I felt that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying, you know.
B:	A little bit much.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yep.
B:	Yep.
B:	Oh, the
A:	Well, that's about all I can say at this time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I think so,
B:	I think that will probably do it,
B:	so.
A:	Okay,
A:	it's been real nice talking with you.
B:	Good enough.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, do you own a P C by the way?
A:	I'm guessing you probably do.
B:	I don't have one in my home here.
B:	My, um, parents have one
B:	and they live just about three miles away,
A:	Oh.
B:	so we use that one.
A:	I see.
B:	And my in-laws also have one,
B:	and they're almost as close.
A:	Right.
B:	They're in Richardson.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	And what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?
B:	Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we got,
B:	uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs,
A:	Great.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so we use those
B:	and there's some,
B:	whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game,
B:	so, that's part of it.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. Uh, his resume, his, uh, letter,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh,
B:	I'm, uh,
B:	my father had a software company,
A:	Oh.
B:	and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, they're kind of old older
A:	Right.
B:	so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Um, I I'm a, a writer by profession
